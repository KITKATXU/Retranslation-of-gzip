   However, we believe that sprintf can be used safely, and is more
   efficient than snprintf in those safe cases; and as proof of our
   belief, we use sprintf in several gnulib modules.  So this header
   intentionally avoids adding a warning to sprintf except when

   <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11959>,
   which sometimes causes an unwanted diagnostic for fwrite calls.
   This affects only function declaration attributes under certain
   versions of gcc and clang, and is not needed for C++.  *//* Here, either ftell is undefined (but C89 guarantees that it is
   declared), or it is defined as rpl_ftell (declared above).  *//* Category 1, above.  *//* Category 3, above.  *//* Category 2, above.  *//* ftell, ftello.  See the comments on fseek/fseeko.  *//* Here, either fseek is undefined (but C89 guarantees that it is
   declared), or it is defined as rpl_fseek (declared above).  *//* Provide an fseeko function that is aware of a preceding fflush(), and which
   detects pipes.  *//* Set up the following warnings, based on which modules are in use.
   GNU Coding Standards discourage the use of fseek, since it imposes
   an arbitrary limitation on some 32-bit hosts.  Remember that the
   fseek module depends on the fseeko module, so we only have three
   cases to consider:

   1. The developer is not using either module.  Issue a warning under
   GNULIB_POSIXCHECK for both functions, to remind them that both
   functions have bugs on some systems.  _GL_NO_LARGE_FILES has no
   impact on this warning.

   2. The developer is using both modules.  They may be unaware of the
   arbitrary limitations of fseek, so issue a warning under
   GNULIB_POSIXCHECK.  On the other hand, they may be using both
   modules intentionally, so the developer can define
   _GL_NO_LARGE_FILES in the compilation units where the use of fseek
   is safe, to silence the warning.

   3. The developer is using the fseeko module, but not fseek.  Gnulib
   guarantees that fseek will still work around platform bugs in that
   case, but we presume that the developer is aware of the pitfalls of
   fseek and was trying to avoid it, so issue a warning even when
   GNULIB_POSIXCHECK is undefined.  Again, _GL_NO_LARGE_FILES can be
   defined to silence the warning in particular compilation units.
   In C++ compilations with GNULIB_NAMESPACE, in order to avoid that
   fseek gets defined as a macro, it is recommended that the developer
   uses the fseek module, even if he is not calling the fseek function.

   Most gnulib clients that perform stream operations should fall into
   category 3.  *//* Assume freopen is always declared.  *//* Discard all pending buffered I/O data on STREAM.
   STREAM must not be wide-character oriented.
   When discarding pending output, the file position is set back to where it
   was before the write calls.  When discarding pending input, the file
   position is advanced to match the end of the previously read input.
   Return 0 if successful.  Upon error, return -1 and set errno.  *//* Assume fprintf is always declared.  *//* Assume fopen is always declared.  *//* Assume fflush is always declared.  *//* Flush all pending data on STREAM according to POSIX rules.  Both
   output and seekable input streams are supported.
   Note! LOSS OF DATA can occur if fflush is applied on an input stream
   that is _not_seekable_ or on an update stream that is _not_seekable_
   and in which the most recent operation was input.  Seekability can
   be tested with lseek(fileno(fp),0,SEEK_CUR).  *//* Assume fdopen is always declared.  *//* Assume fclose is always declared.  *//* Close STREAM and its underlying file descriptor.  *//* When also using extern inline, suppress the use of static inline in
   standard headers of problematic Apple configurations, as Libc at
   least through Libc-825.26 (2013-04-09) mishandles it; see, e.g.,
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html>.
   Perhaps Apple will fix this some day.  *//* Macros for stringification.  *//* _GL_WARN_EXTERN_C declaration;
   performs the declaration with C linkage.  *//* Unsupported.  *//* Verify the existence of the function.  *//* _GL_WARN_ON_USE_CXX (function, rettype, parameters_and_attributes, "string")
   is like _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "string"), except that the function is
   declared with the given prototype, consisting of return type, parameters,
   and attributes.
   This variant is useful for overloaded functions in C++. _GL_WARN_ON_USE does
   not work in this case.  *//* A compiler attribute is available in gcc versions 4.3.0 and later.  *//* _GL_WARN_ON_USE (function, "literal string") issues a declaration
   for FUNCTION which will then trigger a compiler warning containing
   the text of "literal string" anywhere that function is called, if
   supported by the compiler.  If the compiler does not support this
   feature, the macro expands to an unused extern declaration.

   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("literal string") expands to the
   attribute used in _GL_WARN_ON_USE.  If the compiler does not support
   this feature, it expands to empty.

   These macros are useful for marking a function as a potential
   portability trap, with the intent that "literal string" include
   instructions on the replacement function that should be used
   instead.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is for functions with 'extern' linkage.
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE is for functions with 'static' or 'inline'
   linkage.

   However, one of the reasons that a function is a portability trap is
   if it has the wrong signature.  Declaring FUNCTION with a different
   signature in C is a compilation error, so this macro must use the
   same type as any existing declaration so that programs that avoid
   the problematic FUNCTION do not fail to compile merely because they
   included a header that poisoned the function.  But this implies that
   _GL_WARN_ON_USE is only safe to use if FUNCTION is known to already
   have a declaration.  Use of this macro implies that there must not
   be any other macro hiding the declaration of FUNCTION; but
   undefining FUNCTION first is part of the poisoning process anyway
   (although for symbols that are provided only via a macro, the result
   is a compilation error rather than a warning containing
   "literal string").  Also note that in C++, it is only safe to use if
   FUNCTION has no overloads.

   For an example, it is possible to poison 'getline' by:
   - adding a call to gl_WARN_ON_USE_PREPARE([[#include <stdio.h>]],
     [getline]) in configure.ac, which potentially defines
     HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
   - adding this code to a header that wraps the system <stdio.h>:
     #undef getline
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_GETLINE
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (getline, "getline is required by POSIX 2008, but"
       "not universally present; use the gnulib module getline");
     #endif

   It is not possible to directly poison global variables.  But it is
   possible to write a wrapper accessor function, and poison that
   (less common usage, like &environ, will cause a compilation error
   rather than issue the nice warning, but the end result of informing
   the developer about their portability problem is still achieved):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE (rpl_environ, "environ is not always properly declared");
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif
   or better (avoiding contradictory use of 'static' and 'extern'):
     #if HAVE_RAW_DECL_ENVIRON
     static char ***
     _GL_WARN_ON_USE_ATTRIBUTE ("environ is not always properly declared")
     rpl_environ (void) { return &environ; }
     # undef environ
     # define environ (*rpl_environ ())
     #endif

   causes a warning to be emitted when the given overloaded variant of ::func
   is used but not when GNULIB_NAMESPACE::func is used.  *//* _GL_CXXALIASWARN (func);
   causes a warning to be emitted when ::func is used but not when
   GNULIB_NAMESPACE::func is used.  func must be defined without overloaded
   variants.  *//* The outer cast must be a reinterpret_cast.
     The inner cast: When the function is defined as a set of overloaded
     functions, it works as a static_cast<>, choosing the designated variant.
     When the function is defined as a single variant, it works as a
     reinterpret_cast<>. The parenthesized cast syntax works both ways.  *//* _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS_CAST2 (func, rettype, parameters, rettype2, parameters2);
   is like  _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS (func, rettype, parameters);
   except that the C function is picked among a set of overloaded functions,
   namely the one with rettype2 and parameters2.  Two consecutive casts
   are used to silence the "cannot find a match" and "invalid conversion"
   errors that would otherwise occur.  *//* _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS_CAST (func, rettype, parameters);
   is like  _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS (func, rettype, parameters);
   except that the C function func may have a slightly different declaration.
   A cast is used to silence the "invalid conversion" error that would
   otherwise occur.  *//* _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS (func, rettype, parameters);
   declares a C++ alias called GNULIB_NAMESPACE::func
   that redirects to the system provided function func, if GNULIB_NAMESPACE
   is defined.
   Example:
     _GL_CXXALIAS_SYS (open, int, (const char *filename, int flags, ...));

   Wrapping func in an object with an inline conversion operator
   avoids a reference to func unless GNULIB_NAMESPACE::func is
   actually used in the program.  *//* _GL_CXXALIAS_RPL_CAST_1 (func, rpl_func, rettype, parameters);
   is like  _GL_CXXALIAS_RPL_1 (func, rpl_func, rettype, parameters);
   except that the C function rpl_func may have a slightly different

   that would otherwise occur.  *//* _GL_CXXALIAS_RPL (func, rettype, parameters);
   declares a C++ alias called GNULIB_NAMESPACE::func
   that redirects to rpl_func, if GNULIB_NAMESPACE is defined.
   Example:
     _GL_CXXALIAS_RPL (open, int, (const char *filename, int flags, ...));

   Wrapping rpl_func in an object with an inline conversion operator
   avoids a reference to rpl_func unless GNULIB_NAMESPACE::func is

   declares the system function, named func, with the given prototype,
   consisting of return type, parameters, and attributes.
   Example:
     _GL_FUNCDECL_SYS (open, int, (const char *filename, int flags, ...)
                                  _GL_ARG_NONNULL ((1)));
 *//* _GL_FUNCDECL_RPL (func, rettype, parameters_and_attributes);
   declares a replacement function, named rpl_func, with the given prototype,
   consisting of return type, parameters, and attributes.
   Example:
     _GL_FUNCDECL_RPL (open, int, (const char *filename, int flags, ...)
                                  _GL_ARG_NONNULL ((1)));
 *//* _GL_EXTERN_C declaration;
   performs the declaration with C linkage.  *//* The three most frequent use cases of these macros are:

   * For providing a substitute for a function that is missing on some
     platforms, but is declared and works fine on the platforms on which
     it exists:

       #if @GNULIB_FOO@
       # if !@HAVE_FOO@
       _GL_FUNCDECL_SYS (foo, ...);
       # endif

       _GL_CXXALIASWARN (foo);
       #elif defined GNULIB_POSIXCHECK
       ...
       #endif

   * For providing a replacement for a function that exists on all platforms,
     but is broken/insufficient and needs to be replaced on some platforms:

 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Output variable-length bit strings. Compression can be done
 *      to a file or to memory. (The latter is not supported in this version.)
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The PKZIP "deflate" file format interprets compressed file data
 *      as a sequence of bits.  Multi-bit strings in the file may cross
 *      byte boundaries without restriction.
 *
 *      The first bit of each byte is the low-order bit.
 *
 *      The routines in this file allow a variable-length bit value to
 *      be output right-to-left (useful for literal values). For
 *      left-to-right output (useful for code strings from the tree routines),
 *      the bits must have been reversed first with bi_reverse().
 *
 *      For in-memory compression, the compressed bit stream goes directly
 *      into the requested output buffer. The input data is read in blocks
 *      by the mem_read() function. The buffer is limited to 64K on 16 bit
 *      machines.
 *
 *  INTERFACE
 *
 *      void bi_init (FILE *zipfile)
 *          Initialize the bit string routines.
 *
 *      void send_bits (int value, int length)
 *          Write out a bit string, taking the source bits right to
 *          left.

 *  PURPOSE
 *
 *      Identify new text as repetitions of old text within a fixed-
 *      length sliding window trailing behind the new text.
 *
 *  DISCUSSION
 *
 *      The "deflation" process depends on being able to identify portions
 *      of the input text which are identical to earlier input (within a
 *      sliding window trailing behind the input currently being processed).
 *
 *      The most straightforward technique turns out to be the fastest for
 *      most input files: try all possible matches and select the longest.
 *      The key feature of this algorithm is that insertions into the string
 *      dictionary are very simple and thus fast, and deletions are avoided
 *      completely. Insertions are performed at each input character, whereas
 *      string matches are performed only when the previous match ends. So it
 *      is preferable to spend more time in matches to allow very fast string
 *      insertions and avoid deletions. The matching algorithm for small
 *      strings is inspired from that of Rabin & Karp. A brute force approach
 *      is used to find longer strings when a small match has been found.
 *      A similar algorithm is used in comic (by Jan-Mark Wams) and freeze
 *      (by Leonid Broukhis).
 *         A previous version of this file used a more sophisticated algorithm
 *      (by Fiala and Greene) which is guaranteed to run in linear amortized
 *      time, but has a larger average cost, uses more memory and is patented.
 *      However the F&G algorithm may be faster for some highly redundant
 *      files if the parameter max_chain_length (described below) is too large.
 *
 *  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 *
 *      The idea of lazy evaluation of matches is due to Jan-Mark Wams, and
 *      I found it in 'freeze' written by Leonid Broukhis.
 *      Thanks to many info-zippers for bug reports and testing.

   take as an argument a handle for the locale which shall be used.  *//* POSIX.1-2008 extended locale interface (see locale.h).  *//* This code is needed for the optimized mapping functions.  *//* Use X/Open or use misc.  *//* These are the same as `toupper' and `tolower' except that they do not
   check the argument for being in the range of a `char'.  *//* Return the part of C that is in the ASCII set

   The declarations here must match those in localeinfo.h.

   In the thread-specific locale model (see `uselocale' in <locale.h>)
   we cannot use global variables for these as was done in the past.
   Instead, the following accessor functions return the address of
   each variable, which is local to the current thread if multithreaded.

   These point into arrays of 384, so they can be indexed by any `unsigned
   char' value [0,255]; by EOF (-1); or by any `signed char' value
   [-128,-1).  ISO C requires that the ctype functions work for `unsigned
   char' values and for EOF; we also support negative `signed char' values
   for broken old programs.  The case conversion arrays are of `int's
   rather than `unsigned char's because tolower (EOF) must be EOF, which
   doesn't fit into an `unsigned char'.  But today more important is that
   the arrays are also used for multi-byte character sets.  *//* ! _ISbit  *//* Alphanumeric.  *//* Punctuation.  *//* Control character.  *//* Blank (usually SPC and TAB).  *//* Graphical.  *//* Printing.  *//* Whitespace.  *//* Hexadecimal numeric.  *//* Numeric.  *//* Alphabetic.  *//* lowercase.  *//* UPPERCASE.  *//* __BYTE_ORDER == __LITTLE_ENDIAN *//* These are all the characteristics of characters.
   If there get to be more than 16 distinct characteristics,
   many things must be changed that use `unsigned short int's.

   The characteristics are stored always in network byte order (big
   endian).  We define the bit value interpretations here dependent on the
   machine's byte order.  *//*

   UT is at least as wide as T and is no narrower than unsigned int,
   T is two's complement, and there is no padding or trap representations.
   Assume that converting UT to T yields the low-order bits, as is
   done in all known two's-complement C compilers.  E.g., see:
   https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Integers-implementation.html

   According to the C standard, converting UT to T yields an
   implementation-defined result or signal for values outside T's
   range.  However, code that works around this theoretical problem
   runs afoul of a compiler bug in Oracle Studio 12.3 x86.  See:
   https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2017-04/msg00049.html
   As the compiler bug is real, don't try to work around the
   theoretical problem.  *//* Store the low-order bits of A <op> B into *R, where the operation
   is given by OP.  Use the unsigned type UT for calculation to avoid
   overflow problems.  *R's type is T, with extrema TMIN and TMAX.
   T must be a signed integer type.  Return 1 if the result overflows.  *//* Store the low-order bits of A <op> B into *R, where OP specifies
   the operation.  BUILTIN is the builtin operation, and OVERFLOW the
   overflow predicate.  Return 1 if the result overflows.  See above
   for restrictions.  *//* Nonzero if this compiler has GCC bug 68193 or Clang bug 25390.  See:
   https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=68193
   https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25390
   For now, assume all versions of GCC-like compilers generate bogus
   warnings for _Generic.  This matters only for older compilers that
   lack __builtin_add_overflow.  *//* Store the low-order bits of A + B, A - B, A * B, respectively, into *R.
   Return 1 if the result overflows.  See above for restrictions.  *//* Return 1 if the expression A <op> B would overflow,
   where OP_RESULT_OVERFLOW (A, B, MIN, MAX) does the actual test,
   assuming MIN and MAX are the minimum and maximum for the result type.
   Arguments should be free of side effects.  *//* Check for integer overflow, and report low order bits of answer.

   The INT_<op>_OVERFLOW macros return 1 if the corresponding C operators
   might not yield numerically correct answers due to arithmetic overflow.
   The INT_<op>_WRAPV macros also store the low-order bits of the answer.
   These macros work correctly on all known practical hosts, and do not rely
   on undefined behavior due to signed arithmetic overflow.

   Example usage, assuming A and B are long int:

     if (INT_MULTIPLY_OVERFLOW (a, b))
       printf ("result would overflow\n");
     else
       printf ("result is %ld (no overflow)\n", a * b);

   Example usage with WRAPV flavor:

     long int result;
     bool overflow = INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV (a, b, &result);
     printf ("result is %ld (%s)\n", result,
             overflow ? "after overflow" : "no overflow");

   Restrictions on these macros:

   These macros do not check for all possible numerical problems or
   undefined or unspecified behavior: they do not check for division
   by zero, for bad shift counts, or for shifting negative numbers.

   These macros may evaluate their arguments zero or multiple times, so the
   arguments should not have side effects.

   The WRAPV macros are not constant expressions.  They support only
   +, binary -, and *.  The result type must be signed.

   These macros are tuned for their last argument being a constant.

   Return 1 if the integer expressions A * B, A - B, -A, A * B, A / B,
   A % B, and A << B would overflow, respectively.  *//* Return a nonzero value if A is a mathematical multiple of B, where
   A is unsigned, B is negative, and MAX is the maximum value of A's
   type.  A's type must be the same as (A % B)'s type.  Normally (A %
   -B == 0) suffices, but things get tricky if -B would overflow.  *//* The _GL*_OVERFLOW macros have the same restrictions as the
   *_RANGE_OVERFLOW macros, except that they do not assume that operands
   (e.g., A and B) have the same type as MIN and MAX.  Instead, they assume
   that the result (e.g., A + B) has that type.  *//* True if __builtin_add_overflow_p (A, B, C) works.  *//* True if __builtin_add_overflow (A, B, P) works when P is non-null.  *//* Return 1 if A << B would overflow in [MIN,MAX] arithmetic.
   See above for restrictions.  Here, MIN and MAX are for A only, and B need
   not be of the same type as the other arguments.  The C standard says that
   behavior is undefined for shifts unless 0 <= B < wordwidth, and that when
   A is negative then A << B has undefined behavior and A >> B has
   implementation-defined behavior, but do not check these other
   restrictions.  *//* Return 1 if A % B would overflow in [MIN,MAX] arithmetic.
   See above for restrictions.  Do not check for division by zero.
   Mathematically, % should never overflow, but on x86-like hosts
   INT_MIN % -1 traps, and the C standard permits this, so treat this
   as an overflow too.  *//* Return 1 if A / B would overflow in [MIN,MAX] arithmetic.
   See above for restrictions.  Do not check for division by zero.  *//* Return 1 if A * B would overflow in [MIN,MAX] arithmetic.
   See above for restrictions.  Avoid && and || as they tickle
   bugs in Sun C 5.11 2010/08/13 and other compilers; see
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2011-05/msg00401.html>.  *//* Return 1 if - A would overflow in [MIN,MAX] arithmetic.
   See above for restrictions.  *//* Return 1 if A - B would overflow in [MIN,MAX] arithmetic.
   See above for restrictions.  *//* Return 1 if A + B would overflow in [MIN,MAX] arithmetic.
   See above for restrictions.  *//* Range overflow checks.

   The INT_<op>_RANGE_OVERFLOW macros return 1 if the corresponding C
   operators might not yield numerically correct answers due to
   arithmetic overflow.  They do not rely on undefined or
   implementation-defined behavior.  Their implementations are simple
   and straightforward, but they are a bit harder to use than the
   INT_<op>_OVERFLOW macros described below.

   Example usage:

     long int i = ...;
     long int j = ...;
     if (INT_MULTIPLY_RANGE_OVERFLOW (i, j, LONG_MIN, LONG_MAX))
       printf ("multiply would overflow");
     else
       printf ("product is %ld", i * j);

   Restrictions on *_RANGE_OVERFLOW macros:

   These macros do not check for all possible numerical problems or
   undefined or unspecified behavior: they do not check for division
   by zero, for bad shift counts, or for shifting negative numbers.

   These macros may evaluate their arguments zero or multiple times,
   so the arguments should not have side effects.  The arithmetic
   arguments (including the MIN and MAX arguments) must be of the same
   integer type after the usual arithmetic conversions, and the type
   must have minimum value MIN and maximum MAX.  Unsigned types should
   use a zero MIN of the proper type.

   These macros are tuned for constant MIN and MAX.  For commutative
   operations such as A + B, they are also tuned for constant B.  *//* Bound on buffer size needed to represent an integer type or expression T,
   including the terminating null.  *//* Bound on length of the string representing an integer type or expression T.
   Subtract 1 for the sign bit if T is signed, and then add 1 more for
   a minus sign if needed.

   Because _GL_SIGNED_TYPE_OR_EXPR sometimes returns 0 when its argument is
   signed, this macro may overestimate the true bound by one byte when
   applied to unsigned types of size 2, 4, 16, ... bytes.  *//* Bound on length of the string representing an unsigned integer
   value representable in B bits.  log10 (2.0) < 146/485.  The
   smallest value of B where this bound is not tight is 2621.  *//* Return 1 if the integer type or expression T might be signed.  Return 0
   if it is definitely unsigned.  This macro does not evaluate its argument,
   and expands to an integer constant expression.  *//* Does the __typeof__ keyword work?  This could be done by
   'configure', but for now it's easier to do it by hand.  *//* This include file assumes that signed types are two's complement without
   padding bits; the above macros have undefined behavior otherwise.
   If this is a problem for you, please let us know how to fix it for your host.
   This assumption is tested by the intprops-tests module.  *//* Work around OpenVMS incompatibility with C99.  *//* The maximum and minimum values for the type of the expression E,
   after integer promotion.  E is not evaluated.  *//* The maximum and minimum values for the integer type T.  *//* The width in bits of the integer type or expression T.
   Do not evaluate T.
   Padding bits are not supported; this is checked at compile-time below.  *//* Minimum and maximum values for integer types and expressions.  *//* Return 1 if the real expression E, after promotion, has a
   signed or floating type.  Do not evaluate E.  *//* True if the real type T is signed.  *//* True if the arithmetic type T is an integer type.  bool counts as
   an integer.  *//* The extra casts in the following macros work around compiler bugs,
   e.g., in Cray C 5.0.3.0.  *//* Act like _GL_INT_CONVERT (E, -V) but work around a bug in IRIX 6.5 cc; see
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2011-05/msg00406.html>.  *//* Return a value with the common real type of E and V and the value of V.
   Do not evaluate E.  *//* Written by Paul Eggert.  *//* intprops.h -- properties of integer types

   For each timestamp T, this code assumes that either:

     * T.tv_nsec is in the range 0..999999999; or
     * T.tv_sec corresponds to a valid leap second on a host that supports
       leap seconds, and T.tv_nsec is in the range 1000000000..1999999999; or
     * T.tv_sec is the minimum time_t value and T.tv_nsec is -1; or
       T.tv_sec is the maximum time_t value and T.tv_nsec is 2000000000.
       This allows for special struct timespec values that are less or
       greater than all possible valid timestamps.

   In all these cases, it is safe to subtract two tv_nsec values and
   convert the result to integer without worrying about overflow on
   any platform of interest to the GNU project, since all such
   platforms have 32-bit int or wider.

   Replacing "a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec" with something like
   "a.tv_nsec < b.tv_nsec ? -1 : a.tv_nsec > b.tv_nsec" would cause
   this function to work in some cases where the above assumption is
   violated, but not in all cases (e.g., a.tv_sec==1, a.tv_nsec==-2,
   b.tv_sec==0, b.tv_nsec==999999999) and is arguably not worth the
   extra instructions.  Using a subtraction has the advantage of
   detecting some invalid cases on platforms that detect integer
   overflow.  *//* Return a timespec with seconds S and nanoseconds NS.  *//* Obsolescent names for backward compatibility.

     type mismatches in all the code that assumes it is an int.  *//* Describe the long-named options requested by the application.
   The LONG_OPTIONS argument to getopt_long or getopt_long_only is a vector
   of 'struct option' terminated by an element containing a name which is
   zero.

   The field 'has_arg' is:
   no_argument		(or 0) if the option does not take an argument,
   required_argument	(or 1) if the option requires an argument,
   optional_argument 	(or 2) if the option takes an optional argument.

   If the field 'flag' is not NULL, it points to a variable that is set
   to the value given in the field 'val' when the option is found, but
   left unchanged if the option is not found.

   To have a long-named option do something other than set an 'int' to
   a compiled-in constant, such as set a value from 'optarg', set the
   option's 'flag' field to zero and its 'val' field to a nonzero
   value (the equivalent single-letter option character, if there is
   one).  For long options that have a zero 'flag' field, 'getopt'
   returns the contents of the 'val' field.  *//* This header should not be used directly; include getopt.h instead.
   Unlike most bits headers, it does not have a protective #error,
   because the guard macro for getopt.h in gnulib is not fixed.  *//* Declarations for getopt (GNU extensions).

   without a cast.  Use templates to work around the problem when
   possible.  *//* Return a pointer to a new buffer of N bytes.  This is like xmalloc,
   except it returns char *.  *//* Set N = floor (1.5 * N) + 1 so that progress is made even if N == 0.
         Check for overflow, so that N * S stays in both ptrdiff_t and
         size_t range.  The check may be slightly conservative, but an
         exact check isn't worth the trouble.  *//* The approximate size to use for initial small allocation
             requests, when the invoking code specifies an old size of
             zero.  This is the largest "small" request for the GNU C
             library malloc.  *//* If P is null, allocate a block of at least *PN such objects;
   otherwise, reallocate P so that it contains more than *PN objects
   each of S bytes.  S must be nonzero.  Set *PN to the new number of
   objects, and return the pointer to the new block.  *PN is never set
   to zero, and the returned pointer is never null.

   Repeated reallocations are guaranteed to make progress, either by
   allocating an initial block with a nonzero size, or by allocating a
   larger block.

   In the following implementation, nonzero sizes are increased by a
   factor of approximately 1.5 so that repeated reallocations have
   O(N) overall cost rather than O(N**2) cost, but the
   specification for this function does not guarantee that rate.

   Here is an example of use:

     int *p = NULL;
     size_t used = 0;
     size_t allocated = 0;

     void
     append_int (int value)
       {
         if (used == allocated)
           p = x2nrealloc (p, &allocated, sizeof *p);
         p[used++] = value;
       }

   This causes x2nrealloc to allocate a block of some nonzero size the
   first time it is called.

   To have finer-grained control over the initial size, set *PN to a
   nonzero value before calling this function with P == NULL.  For
   example:

     int *p = NULL;
     size_t used = 0;
     size_t allocated = 0;
     size_t allocated1 = 1000;

     void
     append_int (int value)
       {
         if (used == allocated)
           {
             p = x2nrealloc (p, &allocated1, sizeof *p);
             allocated = allocated1;
           }
         p[used++] = value;
       }

   *//* Change the size of an allocated block of memory P to an array of N
   objects each of S bytes, with error checking.  S must be nonzero.  *//* Allocate an array of N objects, each with S bytes of memory,

   following macros to a function pointer or array type, you need to typedef
   it first and use the typedef name.  *//* This function is always triggered when memory is exhausted.
   It must be defined by the application, either explicitly
   or by using gnulib's xalloc-die module.  This is the
   function to call when one wants the program to die because of a
   memory allocation failure.  *//* xalloc.h -- malloc with out-of-memory checking

   rune_t in some cases... *//* Why is this file so hard to maintain properly?  In contrast to
   the comment above regarding BSD/386 1.1, on FreeBSD for as long
   as the symbol has existed, _BSD_RUNE_T_ must not stay defined or
   redundant typedefs will occur when stdlib.h is included after this file. *//* Darwin *//* On BSD/386 1.1, at least, machine/ansi.h defines _BSD_WCHAR_T_
   instead of _WCHAR_T_, and _BSD_RUNE_T_ (which, unlike the other
   symbols in the _FOO_T_ family, stays defined even after its
   corresponding type is defined).  If we define wchar_t, then we
   must undef _WCHAR_T_; for BSD/386 1.1 (and perhaps others), if
   we undef _WCHAR_T_, then we must also define rune_t, since 
   headers like runetype.h assume that if machine/ansi.h is included,
   and _BSD_WCHAR_T_ is not defined, then rune_t is available.
   machine/ansi.h says, "Note that _WCHAR_T_ and _RUNE_T_ must be of
   the same type." *//* Cray Unicos/Mk *//* BeOS *//* FreeBSD 5 *//* Define this type if we are doing the whole job,
   or if we want this type in particular.  *//* Wide character type.
   Locale-writers should change this as necessary to
   be big enough to hold unique values not between 0 and 127,
   and not (wchar_t) -1, for each defined multibyte character.  *//* _STDDEF_H or __need_size_t.  *//* __size_t__ *//* __SIZE_T__ *//* _SIZE_T *//* _SYS_SIZE_T_H *//* _T_SIZE_ *//* _T_SIZE *//* __SIZE_T *//* _SIZE_T_ *//* _BSD_SIZE_T_ *//* _SIZE_T_DEFINED_ *//* _SIZE_T_DEFINED *//* _BSD_SIZE_T_DEFINED_ *//* _SIZE_T_DECLARED *//* ___int_size_t_h *//* _GCC_SIZE_T *//* _SIZET_ *//* __size_t *//* !(defined (__GNUG__) && defined (size_t)) *//* __BEOS__ *//* __size_t is a typedef, must not trash it.  *//* in case <sys/types.h> has defined it. *//* Unsigned type of `sizeof' something.  *//* _STDDEF_H or __need_ptrdiff_t.  *//* If this symbol has done its job, get rid of it.  *//* _PTRDIFF_T *//* _T_PTRDIFF_ *//* _T_PTRDIFF *//* __PTRDIFF_T *//* _PTRDIFF_T_ *//* _BSD_PTRDIFF_T_ *//* ___int_ptrdiff_t_h *//* _GCC_PTRDIFF_T *//* _PTRDIFF_T_DECLARED *//* DragonFly *//* Signed type of difference of two pointers.  *//* In case nobody has defined these types, but we aren't running under
   GCC 2.00, make sure that __PTRDIFF_TYPE__, __SIZE_TYPE__, and
   __WCHAR_TYPE__ have reasonable values.  This can happen if the
   parts of GCC is compiled by an older compiler, that actually
   include gstddef.h, such as collect2.  *//* On VxWorks, <type/vxTypesBase.h> may have defined macros like
   _TYPE_size_t which will typedef size_t.  fixincludes patched the
   vxTypesBase.h so that this macro is only defined if _GCC_SIZE_T is
   not defined, and so that defining this macro defines _GCC_SIZE_T.
   If we find that the macros are still defined at this point, we must
   invoke them so that the type is defined as expected.  *//* Sequent's header files use _PTRDIFF_T_ in some conflicting way.
   Just ignore it.  *//* defined(__NetBSD__) *//* Undef _FOO_T_ if we are supposed to define foo_t.  *//* On BSD/386 1.1, at least, machine/ansi.h defines _BSD_WCHAR_T_
   instead of _WCHAR_T_. *//* This avoids lossage on SunOS but only if stdtypes.h comes first.
   There's no way to win with the other order!  Sun lossage.  *//* snaroff@next.com says the NeXT needs this.  *//* Any one of these symbols __need_* means that GNU libc
   wants us just to define one data type.  So don't define
   the symbols that indicate this file's entire job has been done.  *//*

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with

   Entries for which SELECT returns nonzero are individually malloc'd,
   sorted using qsort with CMP, and collected in a malloc'd array in

   dirent' describing the entry, or NULL for EOF or error.  The
   storage returned may be overwritten by a later readdir call on the

   If the Large File Support API is selected we have to use the
   appropriate interface.

   marked with __THROW.  *//* Close the directory stream DIRP.
   Return 0 if successful, -1 if not.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  *//* Same as opendir, but open the stream on the file descriptor FD.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not

   Return a DIR stream on the directory, or NULL if it could not be opened.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  *//* This is the data type of directory stream objects.
   The actual structure is opaque to users.  *//* Convert between stat structure types and directory types.  *//* File types for `d_type'.  *//* These macros extract size information from a `struct dirent *'.
   They may evaluate their argument multiple times, so it must not
   have side effects.  Each of these may involve a relatively costly
   call to `strlen' on some systems, so these values should be cached.

   _D_EXACT_NAMLEN (DP)	returns the length of DP->d_name, not including
   its terminating null character.

   _D_ALLOC_NAMLEN (DP)	returns a size at least (_D_EXACT_NAMLEN (DP) + 1);
   that is, the allocation size needed to hold the DP->d_name string.
   Use this macro when you don't need the exact length, just an upper bound.
   This macro is less likely to require calling `strlen' than _D_EXACT_NAMLEN.
   *//* Backward compatibility.  *//* This file defines `struct dirent'.

   It defines the macro `_DIRENT_HAVE_D_NAMLEN' iff there is a `d_namlen'
   member that gives the length of `d_name'.

   It defines the macro `_DIRENT_HAVE_D_RECLEN' iff there is a `d_reclen'
   member that gives the size of the entire directory entry.

   It defines the macro `_DIRENT_HAVE_D_OFF' iff there is a `d_off'
   member that gives the file offset of the next directory entry.

   It defines the macro `_DIRENT_HAVE_D_TYPE' iff there is a `d_type'
   member that gives the type of the file.

 * ".tgz" is a useful convention for tar.z files on systems limited

 *//* name might be too long if an original name was saved *//* ========================================================================
 * Create the output file. Return OK or ERROR.
 * Try several times if necessary to avoid truncating the z_suffix. For

   Huffman code decoding is performed using a multi-level table lookup.
   The fastest way to decode is to simply build a lookup table whose
   size is determined by the longest code.  However, the time it takes
   to build this table can also be a factor if the data being decoded
   is not very long.  The most common codes are necessarily the
   shortest codes, so those codes dominate the decoding time, and hence
   the speed.  The idea is you can have a shorter table that decodes the
   shorter, more probable codes, and then point to subsidiary tables for
   the longer codes.  The time it costs to decode the longer codes is
   then traded against the time it takes to make longer tables.

   This results of this trade are in the variables lbits and dbits
   below.  lbits is the number of bits the first level table for literal/
   length codes can decode in one step, and dbits is the same thing for
   the distance codes.  Subsequent tables are also less than or equal to
   those sizes.  These values may be adjusted either when all of the
   codes are shorter than that, in which case the longest code length in
   bits is used, or when the shortest code is *longer* than the requested
   table size, in which case the length of the shortest code in bits is
   used.

   There are two different values for the two tables, since they code a
   different number of possibilities each.  The literal/length table
   codes 286 possible values, or in a flat code, a little over eight
   bits.  The distance table codes 30 possible values, or a little less
   than five bits, flat.  The optimum values for speed end up being
   about one bit more than those, so lbits is 8+1 and dbits is 5+1.
   The optimum values may differ though from machine to machine, and
   possibly even between compilers.  Your mileage may vary.
 *//* bits in bit buffer *//* Macros for inflate() bit peeking and grabbing.
   The usage is:

        NEEDBITS(j)
        x = b & mask_bits[j];
        DUMPBITS(j)

   where NEEDBITS makes sure that b has at least j bits in it, and
   DUMPBITS removes the bits from b.  The macros use the variable k
   for the number of bits in b.  Normally, b and k are register
   variables for speed, and are initialized at the beginning of a
   routine that uses these macros from a global bit buffer and count.
   The macros also use the variable w, which is a cached copy of wp.

   If we assume that EOB will be the longest code, then we will never
   ask for bits with NEEDBITS that are beyond the end of the stream.
   So, NEEDBITS should not read any more bytes than are needed to
   meet the request.  Then no bytes need to be "returned" to the buffer
   at the end of the last block.

   However, this assumption is not true for fixed blocks--the EOB code
   is 7 bits, but the other literal/length codes can be 8 or 9 bits.
   (The EOB code is shorter than other codes because fixed blocks are
   generally short.  So, while a block always has an EOB, many other
   literal/length codes have a significantly lower probability of
   showing up at all.)  However, by making the first table have a
   lookup of seven bits, the EOB code will be found in that first
   lookup, and so will not require that too many bits be pulled from
   the stream.
 *//* Extra bits for distance codes *//* Copy offsets for distance codes 0..29 *//* 99==invalid *//* Extra bits for literal codes 257..285 *//* note: see note #13 above about the 258 in this list. *//* Copy lengths for literal codes 257..285 *//* Order of the bit length code lengths *//* Tables for deflate from PKZIP's appnote.txt. *//* unsigned wp;             current position in slide *//* It is left to other modules to supply the 32K area.  It is assumed
   to be usable as if it were declared "uch slide[32768];" or as just
   "uch *slide;" and then malloc'ed in the latter case.  The definition
   must be in unzip.h, included above. *//* The inflate algorithm uses a sliding 32K byte window on the uncompressed
   stream to find repeated byte strings.  This is implemented here as a
   circular buffer.  The index is updated simply by incrementing and then
   and'ing with 0x7fff (32K-1). *//* Function prototypes *//* pointer to next level of table *//* literal, length base, or distance base *//* number of bits in this code or subcode *//* number of extra bits or operation *//* Huffman code lookup table entry--this entry is four bytes for machines
   that have 16-bit pointers (e.g. PC's in the small or medium model).
   Valid extra bits are 0..13.  e == 15 is EOB (end of block), e == 16
   means that v is a literal, 16 < e < 32 means that v is a pointer to
   the next table, which codes e - 16 bits, and lastly e == 99 indicates
   an unused code.  If a code with e == 99 is looked up, this implies an
   error in the data. *//*
   Notes beyond the 1.93a appnote.txt:

   1. Distance pointers never point before the beginning of the output
      stream.
   2. Distance pointers can point back across blocks, up to 32k away.
   3. There is an implied maximum of 7 bits for the bit length table and
      15 bits for the actual data.
   4. If only one code exists, then it is encoded using one bit.  (Zero
      would be more efficient, but perhaps a little confusing.)  If two
      codes exist, they are coded using one bit each (0 and 1).
   5. There is no way of sending zero distance codes--a dummy must be
      sent if there are none.  (History: a pre 2.0 version of PKZIP would
      store blocks with no distance codes, but this was discovered to be
      too harsh a criterion.)  Valid only for 1.93a.  2.04c does allow
      zero distance codes, which is sent as one code of zero bits in
      length.
   6. There are up to 286 literal/length codes.  Code 256 represents the
      end-of-block.  Note however that the static length tree defines
      288 codes just to fill out the Huffman codes.  Codes 286 and 287
      cannot be used though, since there is no length base or extra bits
      defined for them.  Similarly, there are up to 30 distance codes.
      However, static trees define 32 codes (all 5 bits) to fill out the
      Huffman codes, but the last two had better not show up in the data.
   7. Unzip can check dynamic Huffman blocks for complete code sets.
      The exception is that a single code would not be complete (see #4).
   8. The five bits following the block type is really the number of
      literal codes sent minus 257.
   9. Length codes 8,16,16 are interpreted as 13 length codes of 8 bits
      (1+6+6).  Therefore, to output three times the length, you output
      three codes (1+1+1), whereas to output four times the same length,
      you only need two codes (1+3).  Hmm.
  10. In the tree reconstruction algorithm, Code = Code + Increment
      only if BitLength(i) is not zero.  (Pretty obvious.)
  11. Correction: 4 Bits: # of Bit Length codes - 4     (4 - 19)
  12. Note: length code 284 can represent 227-258, but length code 285
      really is 258.  The last length deserves its own, short code
      since it gets used a lot in very redundant files.  The length
      258 is special since 258 - 3 (the min match length) is 255.
  13. The literal/length and distance code bit lengths are read as a
      single stream of lengths.  It is possible (and advantageous) for
      a repeat code (16, 17, or 18) to go across the boundary between
      the two sets of lengths.
 *//*
   Inflate deflated (PKZIP's method 8 compressed) data.  The compression
   method searches for as much of the current string of bytes (up to a
   length of 258) in the previous 32K bytes.  If it doesn't find any
   matches (of at least length 3), it codes the next byte.  Otherwise, it
   codes the length of the matched string and its distance backwards from
   the current position.  There is a single Huffman code that codes both
   single bytes (called "literals") and match lengths.  A second Huffman
   code codes the distance information, which follows a length code.  Each
   length or distance code actually represents a base value and a number
   of "extra" (sometimes zero) bits to get to add to the base value.  At
   the end of each deflated block is a special end-of-block (EOB) literal/
   length code.  The decoding process is basically: get a literal/length
   code; if EOB then done; if a literal, emit the decoded byte; if a
   length then get the distance and emit the referred-to bytes from the
   sliding window of previously emitted data.

   There are (currently) three kinds of inflate blocks: stored, fixed, and
   dynamic.  The compressor deals with some chunk of data at a time, and
   decides which method to use on a chunk-by-chunk basis.  A chunk might
   typically be 32K or 64K.  If the chunk is uncompressible, then the
   "stored" method is used.  In this case, the bytes are simply stored as
   is, eight bits per byte, with none of the above coding.  The bytes are
   preceded by a count, since there is no longer an EOB code.

   If the data is compressible, then either the fixed or dynamic methods
   are used.  In the dynamic method, the compressed data is preceded by
   an encoding of the literal/length and distance Huffman codes that are
   to be used to decode this block.  The representation is itself Huffman
   coded, and so is preceded by a description of that code.  These code
   descriptions take up a little space, and so for small blocks, there is
   a predefined set of codes, called the fixed codes.  The fixed method is
   used if the block codes up smaller that way (usually for quite small
   chunks), otherwise the dynamic method is used.  In the latter case, the
   codes are customized to the probabilities in the current block, and so
   can code it much better than the pre-determined fixed codes.

   The Huffman codes themselves are decoded using a multi-level table
   lookup, in order to maximize the speed of decoding plus the speed of
   building the decoding tables.  See the comments below that precede the
   lbits and dbits tuning parameters.

   Unlike strcasestr(), this function works correctly in multibyte locales.  *//* Compare the initial segment of the character string STRING consisting of
   at most mbslen (PREFIX) characters with the character string PREFIX,

       prefix separately usually results in a single additional
       cdb_advance_fd call, but it's worthwhile, since it makes the
       code in the following loop cleaner.  *//* Count leading slashes.  *//* If DIR is the empty string, then the chdir above
       must have failed and set errno to ENOENT.  *//* This is a function much like chdir, but without the PATH_MAX limitation
   on the length of the directory name.  A significant difference is that
   it must be able to modify (albeit only temporarily) the directory
   name.  It handles an arbitrarily long directory name by operating
   on manageable portions of the name.  On systems without the openat
   syscall, this means changing the working directory to more and more
   "distant" points along the long directory name and then restoring
   the working directory.  If any of those attempts to save or restore
   the working directory fails, this function exits nonzero.

   Note that this function may still fail with errno == ENAMETOOLONG, but
   only if the specified directory name contains a component that is long
   enough to provoke such a failure all by itself (e.g. if the component
   has length PATH_MAX or greater on systems that define PATH_MAX).  *//* Return a pointer to the first non-slash in S.  *//* Given a file descriptor of an open directory (or AT_FDCWD), CDB->fd,

   descriptor, and return zero.  Upon failure, return -1 and set errno.  *//* The results of openat() in this file are not leaked to any
   single-threaded code that could use stdio.
   FIXME - if the kernel ever adds support for multi-thread safety for
   avoiding standard fds, then we should use openat_safer.  *//* written by Jim Meyering *//* provide a chdir function that tries not to fail due to ENAMETOOLONG

   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.

   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for 'inline void f
   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }', c99 incorrectly complains
   'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function'.
   This bug was observed with Sun C 5.12 SunOS_i386 2011/11/16.

   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
   on configurations that mistakenly use 'static inline' to implement
   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
   from calling static functions (ISO C 99 section 6.7.4.(3).
   This bug is known to occur on:

     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html

     DragonFly; see
     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/bleeding-edge-potential/latest-per-pkg/ah-tty-0.3.12.log

     FreeBSD; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html

   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
   for clang but remains for g++; see <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.

   GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  It defines a macro
   __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ to indicate this situation or a macro
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate the opposite situation.
   GCC 4.2 with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements the GNU C inline
   semantics but warns, unless -fgnu89-inline is used:
     warning: C99 inline functions are not supported; using GNU89
     warning: to disable this warning use -fgnu89-inline or the gnu_inline function attribute
   It defines a macro __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate this situation.

   allocated by the declared function.  *//* For _FORTIFY_SOURCE == 3 we use __builtin_dynamic_object_size, which may
   use the access attribute to get object sizes from function definition
   arguments, so we can't use them on functions we fortify.  Drop the object
   size hints for such functions.  *//* Designates a 1-based positional argument ref-index of pointer type
   that can be used to access size-index elements of the pointed-to
   array according to access mode, or at least one element when
   size-index is not provided:
     access (access-mode, <ref-index> [, <size-index>])  *//* Generic selection (ISO C11) is a C-only feature, available in GCC
   since version 4.9.  Previous versions do not provide generic
   selection, even though they might set __STDC_VERSION__ to 201112L,
   when in -std=c11 mode.  Thus, we must check for !defined __GNUC__
   when testing __STDC_VERSION__ for generic selection support.
   On the other hand, Clang also defines __GNUC__, so a clang-specific
   check is required to enable the use of generic selection.  *//* __glibc_macro_warning (MESSAGE) issues warning MESSAGE.  This is
   intended for use in preprocessor macros.

   Note: MESSAGE must be a _single_ string; concatenation of string
   literals is not supported.  *//* Unused.  *//* Alias name defined manually.  *//* Alias name defined automatically, with leading underscores.  *//* Alias name defined automatically.  *//* Gnulib avoids including these, as they don't work on non-glibc or
   older glibc platforms.  *//* Copies attributes from the declaration or type referenced by
   the argument.  *//* Undefine (also defined in libc-symbols.h).  *//* Describes a char array whose address can safely be passed as the first
   argument to strncpy and strncat, as the char array is not necessarily
   a NUL-terminated string.  *//* Not supported.  *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  *//* Not supported in old GCC.  *//* ISO C99 also allows to declare arrays as non-overlapping.  The syntax is
     array_name[restrict]
   GCC 3.1 and clang support this.
   This syntax is not usable in C++ mode.  *//* Ignore *//* __restrict is known in EGCS 1.2 and above, and in clang.
   It works also in C++ mode (outside of arrays), but only when spelled
   as '__restrict', not 'restrict'.  *//* It is possible to compile containing GCC extensions even if GCC is
   run in pedantic mode if the uses are carefully marked using the
   `__extension__' keyword.  But this is not generally available before
   version 2.8.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above allow passing all anonymous arguments of an
   __extern_always_inline function to some other vararg function.  *//* GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  Using __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__
   or __GNUC_GNU_INLINE is not a good enough check for gcc because gcc versions
   older than 4.3 may define these macros and still not guarantee GNU inlining
   semantics.

   clang++ identifies itself as gcc-4.2, but has support for GNU inlining
   semantics, that can be checked for by using the __GNUC_STDC_INLINE_ and
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ macro definitions.  *//* Associate error messages with the source location of the call site rather
   than with the source location inside the function.  *//* The Linux kernel defines __always_inline in stddef.h (283d7573), and
   it conflicts with this definition.  Therefore undefine it first to
   allow either header to be included first.  *//* Forces a function to be always inlined.  *//* If fortification mode, we warn about unused results of certain
   function calls which can lead to problems.  *//* The returns_nonnull function attribute marks the return type of the function
   as always being non-null.  *//* The nonnull function attribute marks pointer parameters that
   must not be NULL.  This has the name __nonnull in glibc,
   and __attribute_nonnull__ in files shared with Gnulib to avoid
   collision with a different __nonnull in DragonFlyBSD 5.9.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.97 development the `strfmon' format
   attribute for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it
   unconditionally (although this would be possible) since it
   generates warnings.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.8 development the `format_arg' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.
   If several `format_arg' attributes are given for the same function, in
   gcc-3.0 and older, all but the last one are ignored.  In newer gccs,
   all designated arguments are considered.  *//* Since version 4.5, gcc also allows one to specify the message printed
   when a deprecated function is used.  clang claims to be gcc 4.2, but
   may also support this feature.  *//* Since version 3.2, gcc allows marking deprecated functions.  *//* At some point during the gcc 3.1 development the `used' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* This declaration tells the compiler that the value is constant.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `pure' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* Tell the compiler which argument to an allocation function
   indicates the alignment of the allocation.  *//* Tell the compiler which arguments to an allocation function
   indicate the size of the allocation.  *//* At some point during the gcc 2.96 development the `malloc' attribute
   for functions was introduced.  We don't want to use it unconditionally
   (although this would be possible) since it generates warnings.  *//* GCC and clang have various useful declarations that can be made with
   the '__attribute__' syntax.  All of the ways we use this do fine if
   they are omitted for compilers that don't understand it.  *//*
#elif __SOME_OTHER_COMPILER__

# define __REDIRECT(name, proto, alias) name proto; \
	_Pragma("let " #name " = " #alias)
*//* __asm__ ("xyz") is used throughout the headers to rename functions
   at the assembly language level.  This is wrapped by the __REDIRECT
   macro, in order to support compilers that can do this some other
   way.  When compilers don't support asm-names at all, we have to do
   preprocessor tricks instead (which don't have exactly the right
   semantics, but it's the best we can do).

   Example:
   int __REDIRECT(setpgrp, (__pid_t pid, __pid_t pgrp), setpgid); *//* Some other non-C99 compiler.  Approximate with [1].  *//* Pre-2.97 GCC did not support C99 flexible arrays but did have
   an equivalent extension with slightly different notation.  *//* GCC 2.97 and clang support C99 flexible array members as an extension,
   even when in C89 mode or compiling C++ (any version).  *//* Support for flexible arrays.
   Headers that should use flexible arrays only if they're "real"
   (e.g. only if they won't affect sizeof()) should test
   #if __glibc_c99_flexarr_available.  *//* Fortify function f, where object size argument passed to f is the number of
   elements and not total size.  *//* Fortify function f.  __f_alias, __f_chk and __f_chk_warn must be
   declared.  *//* Conversely, we know at compile time that the length is unsafe if the
   __L * __S <= __OBJSZ condition can be folded to a constant and if it is
   false.  *//* Length is known to be safe at compile time if the __L * __S <= __OBJSZ
   condition can be folded to a constant and if it is true.  The -1 check is
   redundant because since it implies that __glibc_safe_len_cond is true.  *//* Compile time conditions to choose between the regular, _chk and _chk_warn
   variants.  These conditions should get evaluated to constant and optimized
   away.  *//* Use __builtin_dynamic_object_size at _FORTIFY_SOURCE=3 when available.  *//* Fortify support.  *//* C++ needs to know that types and declarations are C, not C++.  *//* This is not a typedef so `const __ptr_t' does the right thing.  *//* For these things, GCC behaves the ANSI way normally,
   and the non-ANSI way under -traditional.  *//* These two macros are not used in glibc anymore.  They are kept here
   only because some other projects expect the macros to be defined.  *//* GCC || clang.  *//* No inline functions.  *//* Not GCC or clang.  *//* GCC can always grok prototypes.  For C++ programs we add throw()
   to help it optimize the function calls.  But this only works with
   gcc 2.8.x and egcs.  For gcc 3.4 and up we even mark C functions
   as non-throwing using a function attribute since programs can use
   the -fexceptions options for C code as well.  *//* All functions, except those with callbacks or those that
   synchronize memory, are leaf functions.  *//* Compilers that lack __has_attribute may object to
       #if defined __has_attribute && __has_attribute (...)
   even though they do not need to evaluate the right-hand side of the &&.
   Similarly for __has_builtin, etc.  *//* Some user header file might have defined this before.  *//* The GNU libc does not support any K&R compilers or the traditional mode
   of ISO C compilers anymore.  Check for some of the combinations not
   supported anymore.  *//* We are almost always included from features.h. *//* Copyright (C) 1992-2022 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

   For historic reasons the value now is 6 and this will stay from now
   on.  The use of this variable is deprecated.  Use __GLIBC__ and
   __GLIBC_MINOR__ now (see below) when you want to test for a specific
   GNU C library version and use the values in <gnu/lib-names.h> to get
   the sonames of the shared libraries.  *//* Get definitions of __STDC_* predefined macros, if the compiler has
   not preincluded this header automatically.  *//* GNU formerly extended the scanf functions with modified format
   specifiers %as, %aS, and %a[...] that allocate a buffer for the
   input using malloc.  This extension conflicts with ISO C99, which
   defines %a as a standalone format specifier that reads a floating-
   point number; moreover, POSIX.1-2008 provides the same feature
   using the modifier letter 'm' instead (%ms, %mS, %m[...]).

   We now follow C99 unless GNU extensions are active and the compiler
   is specifically in C89 or C++98 mode (strict or not).  For
   instance, with GCC, -std=gnu11 will have C99-compliant scanf with
   or without -D_GNU_SOURCE, but -std=c89 -D_GNU_SOURCE will have the
   old extension.  *//* The function 'gets' existed in C89, but is impossible to use
   safely.  It has been removed from ISO C11 and ISO C++14.  Note: for
   compatibility with various implementations of <cstdio>, this test
   must consider only the value of __cplusplus when compiling C++.  *//* Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be
   defined in all multithreaded code.  GNU libc has not required this
   for many years.  We now treat them as compatibility synonyms for
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L, which is the earliest level of POSIX with
   comprehensive support for multithreaded code.  Using them never
   lowers the selected level of POSIX conformance, only raises it.  *//* If none of the ANSI/POSIX macros are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE
   is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
   _XOPEN_SOURCE).  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++11.
   Check the temporary macro for now, too.  *//* This is to enable compatibility for ISO C++17.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C90 Amendment 1:1995 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C99 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C11 extension.  *//* This is to enable the ISO C2X extension.  *//* If nothing (other than _GNU_SOURCE and _DEFAULT_SOURCE) is defined,
   define _DEFAULT_SOURCE.  *//* If _GNU_SOURCE was defined by the user, turn on all the other features.  *//* _BSD_SOURCE and _SVID_SOURCE are deprecated aliases for
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE.  If _DEFAULT_SOURCE is present we do not
   issue a warning; the expectation is that the source is being
   transitioned to use the new macro.  *//* Whether to use feature set F.  *//* Similarly for clang.  Features added to GCC after version 4.2 may
   or may not also be available in clang, and clang's definitions of
   __GNUC(_MINOR)__ are fixed at 4 and 2 respectively.  Not all such
   features can be queried via __has_extension/__has_feature.  *//* Convenience macro to test the version of gcc.

			ISO C2X interfaces defined only in Annex F.

   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE_SOURCE Select correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1 or 2; 2 performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE Define correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */ERANGEEDOMEPIPEEMLINKEROFSESPIPEENOSPCEFBIGETXTBSYENOTTYEMFILEENFILEEISDIRENOTDIRENODEVEXDEVEBUSYENOTBLKEFAULTEACCESEAGAINECHILDENOEXECE2BIGENXIOEIOEINTRESRCHEPERM_ASM_GENERIC_ERRNO_BASE_H/* Math result not representable *//* Math argument out of domain of func *//* Broken pipe *//* Too many links *//* Read-only file system *//* Illegal seek *//* No space left on device *//* File too large *//* Text file busy *//* Not a typewriter *//* Too many open files *//* File table overflow *//* Invalid argument *//* Is a directory *//* Not a directory *//* No such device *//* Cross-device link *//* File exists *//* Device or resource busy *//* Block device required *//* Bad address *//* Permission denied *//* Out of memory *//* Try again *//* No child processes *//* Bad file number *//* Exec format error *//* Argument list too long *//* No such device or address *//* I/O error *//* Interrupted system call *//* No such process *//* No such file or directory *//* Operation not permitted *//* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0 WITH Linux-syscall-note *//usr/include/asm-generic<asm-generic/errno-base.h>EHWPOISONERFKILLENOTRECOVERABLEEOWNERDEADEKEYREJECTEDEKEYREVOKEDEKEYEXPIREDENOKEYECANCELEDEMEDIUMTYPEENOMEDIUMEDQUOTEREMOTEIOEISNAMENAVAILENOTNAMEUCLEANESTALEEINPROGRESSEALREADYEHOSTUNREACHEHOSTDOWNECONNREFUSEDETIMEDOUTETOOMANYREFSESHUTDOWNENOTCONNEISCONNENOBUFSECONNRESETECONNABORTEDENETRESETENETUNREACHENETDOWNEADDRNOTAVAILEADDRINUSEEAFNOSUPPORTEPFNOSUPPORTEOPNOTSUPPESOCKTNOSUPPORTEPROTONOSUPPORTENOPROTOOPTEPROTOTYPEEMSGSIZEEDESTADDRREQENOTSOCKEUSERSESTRPIPEERESTARTEILSEQELIBEXECELIBMAXELIBSCNELIBBADELIBACCEREMCHGEBADFDENOTUNIQEOVERFLOWEBADMSGEDOTDOTEMULTIHOPEPROTOECOMMESRMNTEADVENOLINKEREMOTEENOPKGENONETENOSRETIMEENODATAENOSTREBFONTEDEADLOCKEDEADLKEBADSLTEBADRQCENOANOEXFULLEBADREBADEEL2HLTENOCSIEUNATCHELNRNGEL3RSTEL3HLTEL2NSYNCECHRNGEIDRMENOMSGEWOULDBLOCKENOTEMPTYENOSYSENOLCK_ASM_GENERIC_ERRNO_H/* Memory page has hardware error *//* Operation not possible due to RF-kill *//* State not recoverable *//* Owner died *//* for robust mutexes *//* Key was rejected by service *//* Key has been revoked *//* Key has expired *//* Required key not available *//* Operation Canceled *//* Wrong medium type *//* No medium found *//* Quota exceeded *//* Remote I/O error *//* Is a named type file *//* No XENIX semaphores available *//* Not a XENIX named type file *//* Structure needs cleaning *//* Stale file handle *//* Operation now in progress *//* Operation already in progress *//* No route to host *//* Host is down *//* Connection refused *//* Connection timed out *//* Too many references: cannot splice *//* Cannot send after transport endpoint shutdown *//* Transport endpoint is not connected *//* Transport endpoint is already connected *//* No buffer space available *//* Connection reset by peer *//* Software caused connection abort *//* Network dropped connection because of reset *//* Network is unreachable *//* Network is down *//* Cannot assign requested address *//* Address already in use *//* Address family not supported by protocol *//* Protocol family not supported *//* Operation not supported on transport endpoint *//* Socket type not supported *//* Protocol not supported *//* Protocol not available *//* Protocol wrong type for socket *//* Message too long *//* Destination address required *//* Socket operation on non-socket *//* Too many users *//* Streams pipe error *//* Interrupted system call should be restarted *//* Illegal byte sequence *//* Cannot exec a shared library directly *//* Attempting to link in too many shared libraries *//* .lib section in a.out corrupted *//* Accessing a corrupted shared library *//* Can not access a needed shared library *//* Remote address changed *//* File descriptor in bad state *//* Name not unique on network *//* Value too large for defined data type *//* Not a data message *//* RFS specific error *//* Multihop attempted *//* Protocol error *//* Communication error on send *//* Srmount error *//* Advertise error *//* Link has been severed *//* Object is remote *//* Package not installed *//* Machine is not on the network *//* Out of streams resources *//* Timer expired *//* No data available *//* Device not a stream *//* Bad font file format *//* Invalid slot *//* Invalid request code *//* No anode *//* Exchange full *//* Invalid request descriptor *//* Invalid exchange *//* Level 2 halted *//* No CSI structure available *//* Protocol driver not attached *//* Link number out of range *//* Level 3 reset *//* Level 3 halted *//* Level 2 not synchronized *//* Channel number out of range *//* Identifier removed *//* No message of desired type *//* Operation would block *//* Too many symbolic links encountered *//* Directory not empty *//* Invalid system call number *//*

   macros for each of the OS types we define below.  The definitions
   of those macros must use the following macros for underlying types.
   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)
	LONG32		-- 32-bit type, traditionally long
	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  *//* quad_t is also 64 bits.  *//* Smallest types with at least a given width.  *//* Fixed-size types, underlying types depend on word size and compiler.  *//* Convenience types.  *//*
 * Never include this file directly; use <sys/types.h> instead.
 *//* bits/types.h -- definitions of __*_t types underlying *_t types.

 * FALLOC_FL_UNSHARE_RANGE is used to unshare shared blocks within the
 * file size without overwriting any existing data. The purpose of this
 * call is to preemptively reallocate any blocks that are subject to
 * copy-on-write.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
 * granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to filesystem
 * block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or smaller
 * depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the filesystem
 * or file.
 *
 * This flag can only be used with allocate-mode fallocate, which is
 * to say that it cannot be used with the punch, zero, collapse, or
 * insert range modes.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE is use to insert space within the file size without
 * overwriting any existing data. The contents of the file beyond offset are
 * shifted towards right by len bytes to create a hole.  As such, this
 * operation will increase the size of the file by len bytes.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the granularity
 * of the operation. Most will limit operations to filesystem block size
 * boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or smaller depending on
 * the filesystem and/or the configuration of the filesystem or file.
 *
 * Attempting to insert space using this flag at OR beyond the end of
 * the file is considered an illegal operation - just use ftruncate(2) or
 * fallocate(2) with mode 0 for such type of operations.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE is used to convert a range of file to zeros preferably
 * without issuing data IO. Blocks should be preallocated for the regions that
 * span holes in the file, and the entire range is preferable converted to
 * unwritten extents - even though file system may choose to zero out the
 * extent or do whatever which will result in reading zeros from the range
 * while the range remains allocated for the file.
 *
 * This can be also used to preallocate blocks past EOF in the same way as
 * with fallocate. Flag FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE should cause the inode
 * size to remain the same.
 *//*
 * FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE is used to remove a range of a file
 * without leaving a hole in the file. The contents of the file beyond
 * the range being removed is appended to the start offset of the range
 * being removed (i.e. the hole that was punched is "collapsed"),
 * resulting in a file layout that looks like the range that was
 * removed never existed. As such collapsing a range of a file changes
 * the size of the file, reducing it by the same length of the range
 * that has been removed by the operation.
 *
 * Different filesystems may implement different limitations on the
 * granularity of the operation. Most will limit operations to
 * filesystem block size boundaries, but this boundary may be larger or
 * smaller depending on the filesystem and/or the configuration of the
 * filesystem or file.
 *
 * Attempting to collapse a range that crosses the end of the file is

   arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the program name) for
   options given in OPTS.

   Return the option character from OPTS just read.  Return -1 when
   there are no more options.  For unrecognized options, or options
   missing arguments, 'optopt' is set to the option letter, and '?' is
   returned.

   The OPTS string is a list of characters which are recognized option
   letters, optionally followed by colons, specifying that that letter
   takes an argument, to be placed in 'optarg'.

   If a letter in OPTS is followed by two colons, its argument is
   optional.  This behavior is specific to the GNU 'getopt'.

   The argument '--' causes premature termination of argument
   scanning, explicitly telling 'getopt' that there are no more
   options.

   If OPTS begins with '-', then non-option arguments are treated as
   arguments to the option '\1'.  This behavior is specific to the GNU
   'getopt'.  If OPTS begins with '+', or POSIXLY_CORRECT is set in
   the environment, then do not permute arguments.

   For standards compliance, the 'argv' argument has the type
   char *const *, but this is inaccurate; if argument permutation is
   enabled, the argv array (not the strings it points to) must be
   writable.  *//* Set to an option character which was unrecognized.  *//* Callers store zero here to inhibit the error message 'getopt' prints
   for unrecognized options.  *//* Index in ARGV of the next element to be scanned.
   This is used for communication to and from the caller
   and for communication between successive calls to 'getopt'.

   On entry to 'getopt', zero means this is the first call; initialize.

   When 'getopt' returns -1, this is the index of the first of the
   non-option elements that the caller should itself scan.

   Otherwise, 'optind' communicates from one call to the next
   how much of ARGV has been scanned so far.  *//* For communication from 'getopt' to the caller.
   When 'getopt' finds an option that takes an argument,
   the argument value is returned here.
   Also, when 'ordering' is RETURN_IN_ORDER,
   each non-option ARGV-element is returned here.  *//* This header should not be used directly; include getopt.h or
   unistd.h instead.  Unlike most bits headers, it does not have
   a protective #error, because the guard macro for getopt.h in
   gnulib is not fixed.  *//* Declarations for getopt (basic, portable features only).

   range [FROM - N + 1, FROM - 1].  If N is odd the first byte in FROM
   is without partner.  *//* One-way hash PHRASE, returning a string suitable for storage in the
   user database.  SALT selects the one-way function to use, and
   ensures that no two users' hashes are the same, even if they use
   the same passphrase.  The return value points to static storage
   which will be overwritten by the next call to crypt.  *//* Use POSIX199309 *//* Synchronize at least the data part of a file with the underlying
   media.  *//* Copy LENGTH bytes from INFD to OUTFD.  *//* Evaluate EXPRESSION, and repeat as long as it returns -1 with `errno'
   set to EINTR.  *//* Use misc and F_LOCK not already defined.  *//* `lockf' is a simpler interface to the locking facilities of `fcntl'.
   LEN is always relative to the current file position.
   The CMD argument is one of the following.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* NOTE: These declarations also appear in <fcntl.h>; be sure to keep both
   files consistent.  Some systems have them there and some here, and some
   software depends on the macros being defined without including both.  *//* Invoke `system call' number SYSNO, passing it the remaining arguments.
   This is completely system-dependent, and not often useful.

   In Unix, `syscall' sets `errno' for all errors and most calls return -1
   for errors; in many systems you cannot pass arguments or get return
   values for all system calls (`pipe', `fork', and `getppid' typically
   among them).

   In Mach, all system calls take normal arguments and always return an
   error code (zero for success).  *//* Increase or decrease the end of accessible data space by DELTA bytes.
   If successful, returns the address the previous end of data space
   (i.e. the beginning of the new space, if DELTA > 0);
   returns (void *) -1 for errors (with errno set).  *//* Set the end of accessible data space (aka "the break") to ADDR.
   Returns zero on success and -1 for errors (with errno set).  *//* Use POSIX.1b || X/Open Unix || XPG6.  *//* Truncate the file FD is open on to LENGTH bytes.  *//* Use X/Open Unix || POSIX 2008.  *//* Truncate FILE to LENGTH bytes.  *//* Use misc || X/Open Unix.  *//* Return the maximum number of file descriptors
   the current process could possibly have.  *//* Return the number of bytes in a page.  This is the system's page size,
   which is not necessarily the same as the hardware page size.  *//* Make all changes done to all files actually appear on disk.  *//* Return identifier for the current host.  *//* Make all changes done to all files on the file system associated
   with FD actually appear on disk.  *//* Make all changes done to FD actually appear on disk.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Use misc || X/Open.  *//* Prompt with PROMPT and read a string from the terminal without echoing.
   Uses /dev/tty if possible; otherwise stderr and stdin.  *//* Make PATH be the root directory (the starting point for absolute paths).
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Put the program in the background, and dissociate from the controlling
   terminal.  If NOCHDIR is zero, do `chdir ("/")'.  If NOCLOSE is zero,
   redirects stdin, stdout, and stderr to /dev/null.  *//* Rewind and re-read the file.  *//* Discard cached info.  *//* Successive calls return the shells listed in `/etc/shells'.  *//* Turn accounting on if NAME is an existing file.  The system will then write
   a record for each process as it terminates, to this file.  If NAME is NULL,
   turn accounting off.  This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Enable statistical profiling, writing samples of the PC into at most
   SIZE bytes of SAMPLE_BUFFER; every processor clock tick while profiling
   is enabled, the system examines the user PC and increments
   SAMPLE_BUFFER[((PC - OFFSET) / 2) * SCALE / 65536].  If SCALE is zero,
   disable profiling.  Returns zero on success, -1 on error.  *//* Revoke the access of all descriptors currently open on FILE.  *//* Revoke access permissions to all processes currently communicating
   with the control terminal, and then send a SIGHUP signal to the process
   group of the control terminal.  *//* Get and set the NIS (aka YP) domain name, if any.
   Called just like `gethostname' and `sethostname'.
   The NIS domain name is usually the empty string when not using NIS.  *//* Set the current machine's Internet number to ID.
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Set the name of the current host to NAME, which is LEN bytes long.
   This call is restricted to the super-user.  *//* Put the name of the current host in no more than LEN bytes of NAME.
   The result is null-terminated if LEN is large enough for the full
   name and the terminator.  *//* Get definitions and prototypes for functions to process the
   arguments in ARGV (ARGC of them, minus the program name) for
   options given in OPTS.  *//* Set the login name returned by `getlogin'.  *//* Return at most NAME_LEN characters of the login name of the user in NAME.
   If it cannot be determined or some other error occurred, return the error
   code.  Otherwise return 0.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  *//* Return the login name of the user.

   This function is a possible cancellation point and therefore not
   marked with __THROW.  *//* Set the foreground process group ID of FD set PGRP_ID.  *//* Return the foreground process group ID of FD.  *//* Remove the directory PATH.  *//* Remove the link NAME relative to FD.  *//* Remove the link NAME.  *//* Like readlink but a relative PATH is interpreted relative to FD.  *//* Like symlink but a relative path in TO is interpreted relative to TOFD.  *//* Use POSIX.1-2001.  *//* Read the contents of the symbolic link PATH into no more than
   LEN bytes of BUF.  The contents are not null-terminated.
   Returns the number of characters read, or -1 for errors.  *//* Make a symbolic link to FROM named TO.  *//* Like link but relative paths in TO and FROM are interpreted relative
   to FROMFD and TOFD respectively.  *//* Make a link to FROM named TO.  *//* Return 1 if FD is a valid descriptor associated
   with a terminal, zero if not.  *//* Return the pathname of the terminal FD is open on, or NULL on errors.
   The returned storage is good only until the next call to this function.  *//* This is similar to fork, however it does not run the atfork handlers
   neither reinitialize any internal locks in multithread case.
   Different than fork, _Fork is async-signal-safe.  *//* Use misc or XPG < 7. *//* Clone the calling process, but without copying the whole address space.
   The calling process is suspended until the new process exits or is
   replaced by a call to `execve'.  Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.  *//* Clone the calling process, creating an exact copy.
   Return -1 for errors, 0 to the new process,
   and the process ID of the new process to the old process.  *//* Set the real group ID, effective group ID, and saved-set group ID,
   of the calling process to RGID, EGID, and SGID, respectively.  *//* Set the real user ID, effective user ID, and saved-set user ID,
   of the calling process to RUID, EUID, and SUID, respectively.  *//* Fetch the real group ID, effective group ID, and saved-set group ID,
   of the calling process.  *//* Fetch the real user ID, effective user ID, and saved-set user ID,
   of the calling process.  *//* Set the effective group ID of the calling process to GID.  *//* Set the real group ID of the calling process to RGID,
   and the effective group ID of the calling process to EGID.  *//* Set the group ID of the calling process to GID.
   If the calling process is the super-user, set the real
   and effective group IDs, and the saved set-group-ID to GID;
   if not, the effective group ID is set to GID.  *//* Set the effective user ID of the calling process to UID.  *//* Set the real user ID of the calling process to RUID,
   and the effective user ID of the calling process to EUID.  *//* Set the user ID of the calling process to UID.
   If the calling process is the super-user, set the real
   and effective user IDs, and the saved set-user-ID to UID;
   if not, the effective user ID is set to UID.  *//* Return nonzero iff the calling process is in group GID.  *//* If SIZE is zero, return the number of supplementary groups
   the calling process is in.  Otherwise, fill in the group IDs
   of its supplementary groups in LIST and return the number written.  *//* Get the effective group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the real group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the effective user ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the real user ID of the calling process.  *//* Return the session ID of the given process.  *//* Create a new session with the calling process as its leader.
   The process group IDs of the session and the calling process
   are set to the process ID of the calling process, which is returned.  *//* Set the process group ID of the calling process to its own PID.
   This is exactly the same as `setpgid (0, 0)'.  *//* Both System V and BSD have `setpgrp' functions, but with different
   calling conventions.  The BSD function is the same as POSIX.1 `setpgid'
   (above).  The System V function takes no arguments and puts the calling
   process in its on group like `setpgid (0, 0)'.

   New programs should always use `setpgid' instead.

   GNU provides the POSIX.1 function.  *//* Set the process group ID of the process matching PID to PGID.
   If PID is zero, the current process's process group ID is set.
   If PGID is zero, the process ID of the process is used.  *//* Get the process group ID of process PID.  *//* Get the process group ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the process ID of the calling process's parent.  *//* Get the process ID of the calling process.  *//* Get the value of the string-valued system variable NAME.  *//* Get the value of the system variable NAME.  *//* Get file-specific configuration about descriptor FD.  *//* Get file-specific configuration information about PATH.  *//* Get the `_PC_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `pathconf' and `fpathconf';
   the `_SC_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `sysconf';
   and the `_CS_*' symbols for the NAME argument to `confstr'.  *//* Terminate program execution with the low-order 8 bits of STATUS.  *//* Add INC to priority of the current process.  *//* Execute FILE, searching in the `PATH' environment variable if it contains
   no slashes, with arguments ARGV and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute FILE, searching in the `PATH' environment variable if
   it contains no slashes, with all arguments after FILE until a
   NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until
   a NULL pointer and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute PATH with all arguments after PATH until a NULL pointer,
   and the argument after that for environment.  *//* Execute PATH with arguments ARGV and environment from `environ'.  *//* Execute the file FD refers to, overlaying the running program image.
   ARGV and ENVP are passed to the new program, as for `execve'.  *//* Replace the current process, executing PATH with arguments ARGV and
   environment ENVP.  ARGV and ENVP are terminated by NULL pointers.  *//* NULL-terminated array of "NAME=VALUE" environment variables.  *//* Duplicate FD to FD2, closing FD2 and making it open on the same
   file while setting flags according to FLAGS.  *//* Duplicate FD to FD2, closing FD2 and making it open on the same file.  *//* Duplicate FD, returning a new file descriptor on the same file.  *//* Put the absolute pathname of the current working directory in BUF.
   If successful, return BUF.  If not, put an error message in
   BUF and return NULL.  BUF should be at least PATH_MAX bytes long.  *//* Return a malloc'd string containing the current directory name.
   If the environment variable `PWD' is set, and its value is correct,
   that value is used.  *//* Get the pathname of the current working directory,
   and put it in SIZE bytes of BUF.  Returns NULL if the
   directory couldn't be determined or SIZE was too small.
   If successful, returns BUF.  In GNU, if BUF is NULL,
   an array is allocated with `malloc'; the array is SIZE
   bytes long, unless SIZE == 0, in which case it is as
   big as necessary.  *//* Change the process's working directory to the one FD is open on.  *//* Change the process's working directory to PATH.  *//* Change the owner and group of FILE relative to the directory FD is open
   on.  *//* Use X/Open Unix.  *//* Change owner and group of FILE, if it is a symbolic
   link the ownership of the symbolic link is changed.  *//* Change the owner and group of the file that FD is open on.  *//* Change the owner and group of FILE.  *//* Suspend the process until a signal arrives.
   This always returns -1 and sets `errno' to EINTR.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Sleep USECONDS microseconds, or until a signal arrives that is not blocked
   or ignored.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Set an alarm to go off (generating a SIGALRM signal) in VALUE
   microseconds.  If INTERVAL is nonzero, when the alarm goes off, the
   timer is reset to go off every INTERVAL microseconds thereafter.
   Returns the number of microseconds remaining before the alarm.  *//* Make the process sleep for SECONDS seconds, or until a signal arrives
   and is not ignored.  The function returns the number of seconds less
   than SECONDS which it actually slept (thus zero if it slept the full time).
   If a signal handler does a `longjmp' or modifies the handling of the
   SIGALRM signal while inside `sleep' call, the handling of the SIGALRM
   signal afterwards is undefined.  There is no return value to indicate
   error, but if `sleep' returns SECONDS, it probably didn't work.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Schedule an alarm.  In SECONDS seconds, the process will get a SIGALRM.
   If SECONDS is zero, any currently scheduled alarm will be cancelled.
   The function returns the number of seconds remaining until the last
   alarm scheduled would have signaled, or zero if there wasn't one.
   There is no return value to indicate an error, but you can set `errno'
   to 0 and check its value after calling `alarm', and this might tell you.
   The signal may come late due to processor scheduling.  *//* Same as pipe but apply flags passed in FLAGS to the new file
   descriptors.  *//* Create a one-way communication channel (pipe).
   If successful, two file descriptors are stored in PIPEDES;
   bytes written on PIPEDES[1] can be read from PIPEDES[0].
   Returns 0 if successful, -1 if not.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number written, or -1.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number read, -1 for errors
   or 0 for EOF.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number written, or -1.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD at the given position OFFSET without
   changing the file pointer.  Return the number read, -1 for errors
   or 0 for EOF.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Write N bytes of BUF to FD.  Return the number written, or -1.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Read NBYTES into BUF from FD.  Return the
   number read, -1 for errors or 0 for EOF.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Close all open file descriptors greater than or equal to LOWFD.
   Negative LOWFD is clamped to 0.  *//* Close the file descriptor FD.

   This function is a cancellation point and therefore not marked with
   __THROW.  *//* Move FD's file position to OFFSET bytes from the
   beginning of the file (if WHENCE is SEEK_SET),
   the current position (if WHENCE is SEEK_CUR),
   or the end of the file (if WHENCE is SEEK_END).
   Return the new file position.  *//* Old BSD names for the same constants; just for compatibility.  *//* <stdio.h> has the same definitions.  *//* Values for the WHENCE argument to lseek.  *//* Test for access to FILE relative to the directory FD is open on.
   If AT_EACCESS is set in FLAG, then use effective IDs like `eaccess',
   otherwise use real IDs like `access'.  *//* Execute program relative to a directory file descriptor.  *//* An alias for `euidaccess', used by some other systems.  *//* Test for access to NAME using the effective UID and GID
   (as normal file operations use).  *//* Test for access to NAME using the real UID and real GID.  *//* X/Open *//* The Single Unix specification says that some more types are

   which fills the string into the buffer.
   To use the POSIX version, -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=600 or -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=200112L

   Essentially __memcmpeq has the exact same semantics as memcmp
   except the return value is less constrained.  memcmp is always a
   correct implementation of __memcmpeq.  As well !!memcmp, -memcmp,
   or bcmp are correct implementations.

   __memcmpeq is meant to be used by compilers when memcmp return is
   only used for its bolean value.

 */__times__dev/home/qingxiao/retranslation/gzip/lib/fdopendir.cst.st_mode(st.st_mode)!HAVE_FDOPENDIR/* HAVE_FDOPENDIR *//* Like fdopendir, but work around GNU/Hurd bug by validating FD.  *//* The caller has done an elaborate dance to arrange for opendir to
             consume just the right file descriptor.  If dirfd returns -1,
             though, we're on a system like mingw where opendir does not
             consume a file descriptor.  Consume it via 'dup' instead.  *//* Like fdopendir, except the result controls a clone of FD.  It is
   the caller's responsibility both to close FD and (if the result is
   not null) to closedir the result.  *//* Like fdopendir, except that if OLDER_DUPFD is not -1, it is known
   to be a dup of FD which is less than FD - 1 and which will be
   closed by the caller and not otherwise used by the caller.  This
   function makes sure that FD is closed and all file descriptors less
   than FD are open, and then calls fd_clone_opendir on a dup of FD.
   That way, barring race conditions, fd_clone_opendir returns a
   stream whose file descriptor is FD.

   If REPLACE_FCHDIR or CWD is null, use opendir ("/proc/self/fd/...",
   falling back on fchdir metadata.  Otherwise, CWD is a saved version
   of the working directory; use fchdir/opendir(".")/restore_cwd(CWD).  *//* Register our fd *//* Unregister fd registered by opendir() *//* Get a path from fd *//* Replacement for POSIX fdopendir.

   First, try to simulate it via opendir ("/proc/self/fd/...").  Failing
   that, simulate it by using fchdir metadata, or by doing
   save_cwd/fchdir/opendir(".")/restore_cwd.
   If either the save_cwd or the restore_cwd fails (relatively unlikely),
   then give a diagnostic and exit nonzero.

   If successful, the resulting stream is based on FD in
   implementations where streams are based on file descriptors and in
   applications where no other thread or signal handler allocates or
   frees file descriptors.  In other cases, consult dirfd on the result
   to find out whether FD is still being used.

   Otherwise, this function works just like POSIX fdopendir.

   W A R N I N G:

   Unlike other fd-related functions, this one places constraints on FD.
   If this function returns successfully, FD is under control of the
   dirent.h system, and the caller should not close or modify the state of
   FD other than by the dirent.h functions.  *//* provide a replacement fdopendir function

            "... the fgetc() function shall ... advance the associated file
             position indicator for the stream ..."
          <http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/functions/ungetc.html>
            "The file-position indicator is decremented by each successful
             call to ungetc()..."
       2) <http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/functions/ungetc.html> says:
            "The value of the file-position indicator for the stream after
             reading or discarding all pushed-back bytes shall be the same
             as it was before the bytes were pushed back."
          Here we are discarding all pushed-back bytes.  But more specifically,
       3) <http://www.opengroup.org/austin/aardvark/latest/xshbug3.txt> says:
            "[After fflush(),] the file offset of the underlying open file
             description shall be set to the file position of the stream, and
             any characters pushed back onto the stream by ungetc() ... shall
             be discarded."  *//* GNU libc, BeOS, Haiku, Linux libc5 *//* When stream is NULL, POSIX and C99 only require flushing of "output
     streams and update streams in which the most recent operation was not
     input", and all implementations do this.

     When stream is "an output stream or an update stream in which the most
     recent operation was not input", POSIX and C99 requires that fflush
     writes out any buffered data, and all implementations do this.

     When stream is, however, an input stream or an update stream in
     which the most recent operation was input, C99 specifies nothing,
     and POSIX only specifies behavior if the stream is seekable.
     mingw, in particular, drops the input buffer, leaving the file
     descriptor positioned at the end of the input buffer. I.e. ftell
     (stream) is lost.  We don't want to call the implementation's
     fflush in this case.

     We test ! freading (stream) here, rather than fwriting (stream), because
     what we need to know is whether the stream holds a "read buffer", and on
     mingw this is indicated by _IOREAD, regardless of _IOWRT.  *//* Flush all pending data on STREAM according to POSIX rules.  Both

	     Otherwise there would be no way to give the -f short
	     option.

	     On the other hand, if there's a long option "fubar" and
	     the ARGV-element is "-fu", do consider that an
	     abbreviation of the long option, just like "--fu", and
	     not "-f" with arg "u".

	     This distinction seems to be the most useful approach.  *//* "--foo" is always a long option.  The special option
		 "--" was handled above.  *//* We have found another option-ARGV-element.
	 Check whether it might be a long option.  *//* If we have come to a non-option and did not permute it,

	     exchange them so that the options come first.  *//* Give FIRST_NONOPT & LAST_NONOPT rational values if OPTIND has been
	 moved back by the user (who may also have changed the arguments).  *//* Advance to the next ARGV-element.  *//* Test whether ARGV[optind] points to a non-option argument.  *//* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
   given in OPTSTRING.

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If 'getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of the option characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If 'getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating 'optind' and 'nextchar' so that the next call to 'getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, 'getopt' returns -1.
   Then 'optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
   so that those that are not options now come last.)

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set 'opterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in 'optarg'.  Two colons mean an option that
   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
   it is returned in 'optarg', otherwise 'optarg' is set to zero.

   If OPTSTRING starts with '-' or '+', it requests different methods of
   handling the non-option ARGV-elements.
   See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER and REQUIRE_ORDER, above.

   Long-named options begin with '--' instead of '-'.
   Their names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unique
   or is an exact match for some defined option.  If they have an
   argument, it follows the option name in the same ARGV-element, separated
   from the option name by a '=', or else the in next ARGV-element.
   When 'getopt' finds a long-named option, it returns 0 if that option's
   'flag' field is nonzero, the value of the option's 'val' field
   if the 'flag' field is zero.

   The elements of ARGV aren't really const, because we permute them.
   But we pretend they're const in the prototype to be compatible
   with other systems.

   LONGOPTS is a vector of 'struct option' terminated by an
   element containing a name which is zero.

   LONGIND returns the index in LONGOPT of the long-named option found.
   It is only valid when a long-named option has been found by the most
   recent call.

   If LONG_ONLY is nonzero, '-' as well as '--' can introduce
   long-named options.  *//* Determine how to handle the ordering of options and nonoptions.  *//* Start processing options with ARGV-element 1 (since ARGV-element 0
     is the program name); the sequence of previously skipped
     non-option ARGV-elements is empty.  *//* Initialize internal data upon the first call to getopt.  *//* Don't test has_arg with >, because some C compilers don't
	 allow it to be used on enums.  *//* We have found a matching long option.  Consume it.  *//* Otherwise interpret it as a short option.  *//* Can't find it as a long option.  If this is not getopt_long_only,
	 or the option starts with '--' or is not a valid short option,
	 then it's an error.  *//* This must use 'fprintf' even though it's only
		     printing a single character, so that it goes through
		     __fxprintf_nocancel when compiled as part of glibc.  *//* Fall back to simpler error message.  *//* Don't waste effort tracking the ambig set if
			 we're not going to print it anyway.  *//* Second or later nonexact match found.  *//* First nonexact match found.  *//* Didn't find an exact match, so look for abbreviations.  *//* Exact match found.  *//* First look for an exact match, counting the options as a side
     effect.  *//* Do nothing.  *//* Process the argument starting with d->__nextchar as a long option.
   d->optind should *not* have been advanced over this argument.

   If the value returned is -1, it was not actually a long option, the
   state is unchanged, and the argument should be processed as a set
   of short options (this can only happen when long_only is true).
   Otherwise, the option (and its argument, if any) have been consumed
   and the return value is the value to return from _getopt_internal_r.  *//* Update records for the slots the non-options now occupy.  *//* Exclude the moved top segment from further swapping.  *//* Swap it with the bottom part of the bottom segment.  *//* Top segment is the short one.  *//* Exclude the moved bottom segment from further swapping.  *//* Swap it with the top part of the top segment.  *//* Bottom segment is the short one.  *//* Exchange the shorter segment with the far end of the longer segment.
     That puts the shorter segment into the right place.
     It leaves the longer segment in the right place overall,
     but it consists of two parts that need to be swapped next.  *//* Exchange two adjacent subsequences of ARGV.
   One subsequence is elements [first_nonopt,last_nonopt)
   which contains all the non-options that have been skipped so far.
   The other is elements [last_nonopt,optind), which contains all
   the options processed since those non-options were skipped.

   'first_nonopt' and 'last_nonopt' are relocated so that they describe
   the new indices of the non-options in ARGV after they are moved.  *//* Keep a global copy of all internal members of getopt_data.  *//* Set to an option character which was unrecognized.
   This must be initialized on some systems to avoid linking in the
   system's own getopt implementation.  *//* Callers store zero here to inhibit the error message
   for unrecognized options.  *//* 1003.2 says this must be 1 before any call.  *//* This implementation of 'getopt' has three modes for handling
   options interspersed with non-option arguments.  It can stop
   scanning for options at the first non-option argument encountered,
   as POSIX specifies.  It can continue scanning for options after the
   first non-option argument, but permute 'argv' as it goes so that,
   after 'getopt' is done, all the options precede all the non-option
   arguments and 'optind' points to the first non-option argument.
   Or, it can report non-option arguments as if they were arguments to
   the option character '\x01'.

   The default behavior of 'getopt_long' is to permute the argument list.
   When this implementation is used standalone, the default behavior of
   'getopt' is to stop at the first non-option argument, but when it is
   used as part of GNU libc it also permutes the argument list.  In both
   cases, setting the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT to any value
   disables permutation.

   If the first character of the OPTSTRING argument to 'getopt' or
   'getopt_long' is '+', both functions will stop at the first
   non-option argument.  If it is '-', both functions will report
   non-option arguments as arguments to the option character '\x01'.  *//* When used standalone, do not attempt to use alloca.  *//* nop *//* When used standalone, flockfile and funlockfile might not be
   available.  *//* When used as part of glibc, error printing must be done differently
   for standards compliance.  getopt is not a cancellation point, so
   it must not call functions that are, and it is specified by an
   older standard than stdio locking, so it must not refer to
   functions in the "user namespace" related to stdio locking.
   Finally, it must use glibc's internal message translation so that
   the messages are looked up in the proper text domain.  *//* Getopt for GNU.

   There are two macros, since no single macro can be used in all

   integer constant expression contexts.  verify (R) is for declaration

   with a diagnostic that includes the string-literal DIAGNOSTIC.

   Unfortunately, unlike C11, this implementation must appear as an
   ordinary declaration, and cannot appear inside struct { ... }.  *//* Verify requirement R at compile-time, as an integer constant expression

   be portable, R should be an integer constant expression.  Unlike
   assert (R), there is no run-time overhead.

   If _Static_assert works, verify (R) uses it directly.  Similarly,
   _GL_VERIFY_TRUE works by packaging a _Static_assert inside a struct
   that is an operand of sizeof.

   The code below uses several ideas for C++ compilers, and for C
   compilers that do not support _Static_assert:

   * The first step is ((R) ? 1 : -1).  Given an expression R, of
     integral or boolean or floating-point type, this yields an
     expression of integral type, whose value is later verified to be
     constant and nonnegative.

   * Next this expression W is wrapped in a type
     struct _gl_verify_type {
       unsigned int _gl_verify_error_if_negative: W;
     }.
     If W is negative, this yields a compile-time error.  No compiler can
     deal with a bit-field of negative size.

     One might think that an array size check would have the same
     effect, that is, that the type struct { unsigned int dummy[W]; }
     would work as well.  However, inside a function, some compilers
     (such as C++ compilers and GNU C) allow local parameters and
     variables inside array size expressions.  With these compilers,
     an array size check would not properly diagnose this misuse of
     the verify macro:

       void function (int n) { verify (n < 0); }

   * For the verify macro, the struct _gl_verify_type will need to
     somehow be embedded into a declaration.  To be portable, this
     declaration must declare an object, a constant, a function, or a
     typedef name.  If the declared entity uses the type directly,
     such as in

       struct dummy {...};
       typedef struct {...} dummy;
       extern struct {...} *dummy;
       extern void dummy (struct {...} *);
       extern struct {...} *dummy (void);

     two uses of the verify macro would yield colliding declarations
     if the entity names are not disambiguated.  A workaround is to
     attach the current line number to the entity name:

       #define _GL_CONCAT0(x, y) x##y
       #define _GL_CONCAT(x, y) _GL_CONCAT0 (x, y)
       extern struct {...} * _GL_CONCAT (dummy, __LINE__);

     But this has the problem that two invocations of verify from
     within the same macro would collide, since the __LINE__ value
     would be the same for both invocations.  (The GCC __COUNTER__
     macro solves this problem, but is not portable.)

     A solution is to use the sizeof operator.  It yields a number,
     getting rid of the identity of the type.  Declarations like

       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];

     can be repeated.

   * Should the implementation use a named struct or an unnamed struct?
     Which of the following alternatives can be used?

       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern int dummy [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct {...})]);
       extern void dummy (int [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})]);
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];
       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct _gl_verify_type {...})];

     In the second and sixth case, the struct type is exported to the
     outer scope; two such declarations therefore collide.  GCC warns
     about the first, third, and fourth cases.  So the only remaining
     possibility is the fifth case:

       extern int (*dummy (void)) [sizeof (struct {...})];

   * GCC warns about duplicate declarations of the dummy function if
     -Wredundant-decls is used.  GCC 4.3 and later have a builtin
     __COUNTER__ macro that can let us generate unique identifiers for
     each dummy function, to suppress this warning.

   * This implementation exploits the fact that older versions of GCC,
     which do not support _Static_assert, also do not warn about the
     last declaration mentioned above.

   * GCC warns if -Wnested-externs is enabled and verify() is used
     within a function body; but inside a function, you can always
     arrange to use verify_expr() instead.

   * In C++, any struct definition inside sizeof is invalid.
     Use a template type to work around the problem.  *//* FreeBSD 9.1 <sys/cdefs.h>, included by <stddef.h> and lots of other
   system headers, defines a conflicting _Static_assert that is no
   better than ours; override it.  *//* The condition (99 < __GNUC__) is temporary, until we know about the
   first G++ release that supports static_assert.  *//* Define _GL_HAVE__STATIC_ASSERT to 1 if _Static_assert works as per C11.
   This is supported by GCC 4.6.0 and later, in C mode, and its use
   here generates easier-to-read diagnostics when verify (R) fails.

   Define _GL_HAVE_STATIC_ASSERT to 1 if static_assert works as per C++11.
   This will likely be supported by future GCC versions, in C++ mode.

   Use this only with GCC.  If we were willing to slow 'configure'
   down we could also use it with other compilers, but since this
   affects only the quality of diagnostics, why bother?  *//* Written by Paul Eggert, Bruno Haible, and Jim Meyering.  *//* Compile-time assert-like macros.

     Whereas GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime values usually jump by 1 or 2
     microseconds.
     More discussion on this topic:
     <http://www.windowstimestamp.com/description>.  *//* This is a wrapper for gettimeofday.  It is used only on systems
   that lack this function, or whose implementation of this function
   causes problems.
   Work around the bug in some systems whereby gettimeofday clobbers
   the static buffer that localtime uses for its return value.  The
   gettimeofday function from Mac OS X 10.0.4 (i.e., Darwin 1.3.7) has
   this problem.  *//* GetSystemTimePreciseAsFileTime was introduced only in Windows 8.  *//* Avoid warnings from gcc -Wcast-function-type.  *//* Provide gettimeofday for systems that don't have it or for which it's broken.

   The PREPARE handler is called in the parent process just before performing
   FORK. The PARENT handler is called in the parent process just after FORK.
   The CHILD handler is called in the child process.  Each of the three
   handlers can be NULL, meaning that no handler needs to be called at that
   point.
   PTHREAD_ATFORK can be called several times, in which case the PREPARE
   handlers are called in LIFO order (last added with PTHREAD_ATFORK,
   first called before FORK), and the PARENT and CHILD handlers are called
   in FIFO (first added, first called).  *//* Get ID of CPU-time clock for thread THREAD_ID.  *//* Store POINTER in the thread-specific data slot identified by KEY. *//* Return current value of the thread-specific data slot identified by KEY.  *//* Destroy KEY.  *//* Create a key value identifying a location in the thread-specific

   the key is destroyed.  *//* Functions for handling thread-specific data.  *//* Set the process-shared flag of the barrier attribute ATTR.  *//* Get the process-shared flag of the barrier attribute ATTR.  *//* Destroy previously dynamically initialized barrier attribute ATTR.  *//* Initialize barrier attribute ATTR.  *//* Wait on barrier BARRIER.  *//* Destroy a previously dynamically initialized barrier BARRIER.  *//* Initialize BARRIER with the attributes in ATTR.

   'ls' take into consideration the fact that FILE has a trailing slash
   when FILE is a symbolic link.  On Linux and Solaris 10 systems, the
   lstat function already has the desired semantics (in treating
   'lstat ("symlink/", sbuf)' just like 'lstat ("symlink/.", sbuf)',
   but on Solaris 9 and earlier it does not.

   If FILE has a trailing slash and specifies a symbolic link,
   then use stat() to get more info on the referent of FILE.
   If the referent is a non-directory, then set errno to ENOTDIR
   and return -1.  Otherwise, return stat's result.  *//* Get the original definition of lstat.  It might be defined as a macro.  *//* On systems that lack symlinks, our replacement <sys/stat.h> already

   avoid an empty file.  *//* If the user's config.h happens to include <sys/stat.h>, let it include only
   the system's <sys/stat.h> here, so that orig_lstat doesn't recurse to

   This file provides prototype declarations for the math functions.
   Most functions are declared using the macro:

   __MATHCALL (NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This means there is a function `NAME' returning `double' and a function
   `NAMEf' returning `float'.  Each place `_Mdouble_' appears in the
   prototype, that is actually `double' in the prototype for `NAME' and
   `float' in the prototype for `NAMEf'.  Reentrant variant functions are
   called `NAME_r' and `NAMEf_r'.

   Functions returning other types like `int' are declared using the macro:

   __MATHDECL (TYPE, NAME,[_r], (ARGS...));

   This is just like __MATHCALL but for a function returning `TYPE'
   instead of `_Mdouble_'.  In all of these cases, there is still
   both a `NAME' and a `NAMEf' that takes `float' arguments.

   Note that there must be no whitespace before the argument passed for
   NAME, to make token pasting work with -traditional.  *//* Prototype declarations for math functions; helper file for <math.h>.

128-bit long double, _Float128 is defined as long double
     in C++.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
   __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.  Moreover,
   the comparison macros from ISO C take two floating-point arguments,
   which need not have the same type.  Choosing what underlying function
   to call requires evaluating the formats of the arguments, then
   selecting which is wider.  The macro __MATH_EVAL_FMT2 provides this
   information, however, only the type of the macro expansion is
   relevant (actually evaluating the expression would be incorrect).
   Thus, the type is used as a template parameter for __iseqsig_type,
   which calls the appropriate underlying function.  *//* Return X == Y but raising "invalid" and setting errno if X or Y is
   a NaN.  *//* An expression whose type has the widest of the evaluation formats
   of X and Y (which are of floating-point types).  *//* isunordered must always check both operands first for signaling NaNs.  *//* ISO C99 defines some macros to compare number while taking care for
   unordered numbers.  Many FPUs provide special instructions to support
   these operations.  Generic support in GCC for these as builtins went
   in 2.97, but not all cpus added their patterns until 3.1.  Therefore
   we enable the builtins from 3.1 onwards and use a generic implementation
   othwerwise.  *//* 1/sqrt(2) *//* sqrt(2) *//* 2/sqrt(pi) *//* 2/pi *//* 1/pi *//* pi/4 *//* pi/2 *//* pi *//* log_e 10 *//* log_e 2 *//* log_10 e *//* log_2 e *//* e *//* The above constants are not adequate for computation using `long double's.
   Therefore we provide as an extension constants with similar names as a
   GNU extension.  Provide enough digits for the 128-bit IEEE quad.  *//* GNU extension to provide float constants with similar names.  *//* Some useful constants.  *//* X/Open wants another strange constant.  *//* Use IEC_60559_BFP_EXT.  *//* extern C++ *//* Return nonzero value if X is zero.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is subnormal.  *//* When using an IEEE 128-bit long double, _Float128 is defined as long double
   in C++.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
      __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.  On the
      other hand, overloading provides the means to distinguish between
      the floating-point types.  The overloading resolution will match
      the correct parameter (regardless of type qualifiers (i.e.: const
      and volatile)).  *//* Return nonzero value if X is a signaling NaN.  *//* By default all math functions support both errno and exception handling
   (except for soft floating point implementations which may only support
   errno handling).  If errno handling is disabled, exceptions are still
   supported by GLIBC.  Set math_errhandling to 0 with -ffast-math (this is
   nonconforming but it is more useful than leaving it undefined).  *//* Exceptions raised by math functions.  *//* errno set by math functions.  *//* Bitmasks for the math_errhandling macro.  *//* Since __builtin_isinf_sign is broken for float128 before GCC 7.0,
      use the helper function, __isinff128, with older compilers.  This is
      only provided for C mode, because in C++ mode, GCC has no support
      for __builtin_types_compatible_p (and when in C++ mode, this macro is
      not used anyway, because libstdc++ headers undefine it).  *//* Return nonzero value if X is positive or negative infinity.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is a NaN.  We could use `fpclassify' but
   we already have this functions `__isnan' and it is faster.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is neither zero, subnormal, Inf, nor NaN.  *//* Return nonzero value if X is not +-Inf or NaN.  *//* In C++ mode, __MATH_TG cannot be used, because it relies on
     __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is a C-only builtin.
     The check for __cplusplus allows the use of the builtin instead of
     __MATH_TG. This is provided for libstdc++, only to let its configure
     test work. No further use of this definition of signbit is expected

     sizeof (longword) bytes starting at char_ptr is == c.  On little-endian
     machines, we could determine the first such byte without any further
     memory accesses, just by looking at the tmp result from the last loop
     iteration.  But this does not work on big-endian machines.  Choose code
     that works in both cases.  *//* Instead of the traditional loop which tests each byte, we will test a
     longword at a time.  The tricky part is testing if *any of the four*
     bytes in the longword in question are equal to c.  We first use an xor
     with repeated_c.  This reduces the task to testing whether *any of the
     four* bytes in longword1 is zero.

     We compute tmp =
       ((longword1 - repeated_one) & ~longword1) & (repeated_one << 7).
     That is, we perform the following operations:
       1. Subtract repeated_one.
       2. & ~longword1.
       3. & a mask consisting of 0x80 in every byte.
     Consider what happens in each byte:
       - If a byte of longword1 is zero, step 1 and 2 transform it into 0xff,
         and step 3 transforms it into 0x80.  A carry can also be propagated
         to more significant bytes.
       - If a byte of longword1 is nonzero, let its lowest 1 bit be at
         position k (0 <= k <= 7); so the lowest k bits are 0.  After step 1,
         the byte ends in a single bit of value 0 and k bits of value 1.
         After step 2, the result is just k bits of value 1: 2^k - 1.  After
         step 3, the result is 0.  And no carry is produced.
     So, if longword1 has only non-zero bytes, tmp is zero.
     Whereas if longword1 has a zero byte, call j the position of the least
     significant zero byte.  Then the result has a zero at positions 0, ...,
     j-1 and a 0x80 at position j.  We cannot predict the result at the more
     significant bytes (positions j+1..3), but it does not matter since we
     already have a non-zero bit at position 8*j+7.

     So, the test whether any byte in longword1 is zero is equivalent to
     testing whether tmp is nonzero.  *//* Compute auxiliary longword values:
     repeated_one is a value which has a 1 in every byte.
     repeated_c has c in every byte.  *//* All these elucidatory comments refer to 4-byte longwords,
     but the theory applies equally well to any size longwords.  *//* Handle the first few bytes by reading one byte at a time.
     Do this until CHAR_PTR is aligned on a longword boundary.  *//* On 32-bit hardware, choosing longword to be a 32-bit unsigned
     long instead of a 64-bit uintmax_t tends to give better
     performance.  On 64-bit hardware, unsigned long is generally 64
     bits already.  Change this typedef to experiment with
     performance.  *//* Search no more than N bytes of S for C.  *//* Copyright (C) 1991, 1993, 1996-1997, 1999-2000, 2003-2004, 2006, 2008-2018

   using save_cwd and restore_cwd.  *//* Don't write a message to just-created fd 2.  *//* If saving the working directory collides with the user's
         requested fd, then the user's fd must have been closed to
         begin with.  *//* If the syscall succeeds, or if it fails with an unexpected
           errno value, then return right away.  Otherwise, fall through
           and resort to using save_cwd/restore_cwd.  *//* Like openat (FD, FILE, FLAGS, MODE), but if CWD_ERRNO is
   nonnull, set *CWD_ERRNO to an errno value if unable to save
   or restore the initial working directory.  This is needed only
   the first time remove.c's remove_dir opens a command-line
   directory argument.

   If a previous attempt to restore the current working directory
   failed, then we must not even try to access a '.'-relative name.
   It is the caller's responsibility not to call this function
   in that case.  *//* Replacement for Solaris' openat function.
   <https://www.google.com/search?q=openat+site:docs.oracle.com>
   First, try to simulate it via open ("/proc/self/fd/FD/FILE").
   Failing that, simulate it by doing save_cwd/fchdir/open/restore_cwd.
   If either the save_cwd or the restore_cwd fails (relatively unlikely),
   then give a diagnostic and exit nonzero.
   Otherwise, upon failure, set errno and return -1, as openat does.
   Upon successful completion, return a file descriptor.  *//* solely for definition of IS_ABSOLUTE_FILE_NAME *//* We know len is positive, since open did not fail with ENOENT.  *//* If the filename ends in a slash and fd does not refer to a directory,
     then fail.
     Rationale: POSIX <http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html>
     says that
       "A pathname that contains at least one non-slash character and that
        ends with one or more trailing slashes shall be resolved as if a
        single dot character ( '.' ) were appended to the pathname."
     and
       "The special filename dot shall refer to the directory specified by
        its predecessor."
     If the named file without the slash is not a directory, open() must fail
     with ENOTDIR.  *//* If the filename ends in a slash and one of O_CREAT, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
     is specified, then fail.
     Rationale: POSIX <http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html>
     says that
       "A pathname that contains at least one non-slash character and that
        ends with one or more trailing slashes shall be resolved as if a
        single dot character ( '.' ) were appended to the pathname."
     and
       "The special filename dot shall refer to the directory specified by
        its predecessor."
     If the named file already exists as a directory, then
       - if O_CREAT is specified, open() must fail because of the semantics
         of O_CREAT,
       - if O_WRONLY or O_RDWR is specified, open() must fail because POSIX
         <http://www.opengroup.org/susv3/functions/open.html> says that it
         fails with errno = EISDIR in this case.
     If the named file does not exist or does not name a directory, then
       - if O_CREAT is specified, open() must fail since open() cannot create
         directories,
       - if O_WRONLY or O_RDWR is specified, open() must fail because the
         file does not contain a '.' directory.  *//* 0 = unknown, 1 = yes, -1 = no.  *//* Like openat, but support O_CLOEXEC and work around Solaris 9 bugs
   with trailing slash.  *//* Write "fcntl.h" here, not <fcntl.h>, otherwise OSF/1 5.1 DTK cc eliminates
   this include because of the preliminary #include <fcntl.h> above.  *//* Get the original definition of open.  It might be defined as a macro.  *//* If the user's config.h happens to include <fcntl.h>, let it include only
   the system's <fcntl.h> here, so that orig_openat doesn't recurse to
   rpl_openat.  *//* provide a replacement openat function

     and once directly.  In both situations 'wint_t' is not yet defined,
     therefore we cannot provide the function overrides; instead include only
     the system's <wchar.h>.
   - With MinGW 3.22, when <string.h> includes <wchar.h>, only some part of
     <wchar.h> is actually processed, and that doesn't include 'mbstate_t'.
   - On IRIX 6.5, similarly, we have an include <wchar.h> -> <wctype.h>, and
     the latter includes <wchar.h>.  But here, we have no way to detect whether
     <wctype.h> is completely included or is still being included.  *//*
 * ISO C 99 <wchar.h> for platforms that have issues.

   Prior to this (for C99/C11) the definitions were:

	-1  indeterminate

	 1  evaluate operations and constants of type float and double
	    to the range and precision of the double type, evaluate
	    long double operations and constants to the range and
	    precision of the long double type
	 2  evaluate all operations and constants to the range and
	    precision of the long double type

   The TS 18661-3 definitions are:

	-1  indeterminate
	 0  evaluate all operations and constants, whose semantic type has
	    at most the range and precision of float, to the range and
	    precision of float; evaluate all other operations and constants
	    to the range and precision of the semantic type.
	 1  evaluate all operations and constants, whose semantic type has
	    at most the range and precision of double, to the range and
	    precision of double; evaluate all other operations and constants
	    to the range and precision of the semantic type.
	 2  evaluate all operations and constants, whose semantic type has
	    at most the range and precision of long double, to the range and
	    precision of long double; evaluate all other operations and
	    constants to the range and precision of the semantic type.
	 N  where _FloatN  is a supported interchange floating type
	    evaluate all operations and constants, whose semantic type has
	    at most the range and precision of the _FloatN type, to the
	    range and precision of the _FloatN type; evaluate all other
	    operations and constants to the range and precision of the
	    semantic type.
	 N + 1, where _FloatNx is a supported extended floating type
	    evaluate operations and constants, whose semantic type has at
	    most the range and precision of the _FloatNx type, to the range
	    and precision of the _FloatNx type; evaluate all other
	    operations and constants to the range and precision of the
	    semantic type.

   The compiler predefines two macros:

      __FLT_EVAL_METHOD__
      Which, depending on the value given for
      -fpermitted-flt-eval-methods, may be limited to only those values
      for FLT_EVAL_METHOD defined in C99/C11.

     __FLT_EVAL_METHOD_TS_18661_3__
      Which always permits the values for FLT_EVAL_METHOD defined in
      ISO/IEC TS 18661-3.

     Here we want to use __FLT_EVAL_METHOD__, unless
     __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__ is defined, in which case the user
     is specifically asking for the ISO/IEC TS 18661-3 types, so we use
     __FLT_EVAL_METHOD_TS_18661_3__.

 *//* The i386 floating point hardware (the 387 compatible FPU, not the modern
   SSE/SSE2 hardware) has a controllable rounding precision.  It is specified
   through the 'PC' bits in the FPU control word ('fctrl' register).  (See
   the GNU libc i386 <fpu_control.h> header for details.)

   On some platforms, such as Linux or Solaris, the default precision setting
   is set to "extended precision".  This means that 'long double' instructions
   operate correctly, but 'double' computations often produce slightly
   different results as on strictly IEEE 754 conforming systems.

   On some platforms, such as NetBSD, the default precision is set to
   "double precision".  This means that 'long double' instructions will operate
   only as 'double', i.e. lead to wrong results.  Similarly on FreeBSD 6.4, at
   least for the division of 'long double' numbers.

   The FPU control word is under control of the application, i.e. it is
   not required to be set either way by the ABI.  (In fact, the i386 ABI
   https://www.linux-mips.org/pub/linux/mips/doc/ABI/abi386-4.pdf page 3-12 = page 38
   is not clear about it.  But in any case, gcc treats the control word
   like a "preserved" register: it emits code that assumes that the control
   word is preserved across calls, and it restores the control word at the
   end of functions that modify it.)

   See Vincent Lefvre's page https://www.vinc17.net/research/extended.en.html
   for a good explanation.
   See http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0103.0/0453.html for

   returns a piece of memory that is way too small, and the program then
   crashes while attempting to fill the memory.
   To avoid this, the functions and macros in this file check for overflow.
   The convention is that SIZE_MAX represents overflow.
   malloc (SIZE_MAX) is not guaranteed to fail -- think of a malloc
   implementation that uses mmap --, it's recommended to use size_overflow_p()
   or size_in_bounds_p() before invoking malloc().
   The example thus becomes:
      size_t size = xsum (header_size, xtimes (n, element_size));
      void *p = (size_in_bounds_p (size) ? malloc (size) : NULL);
*//* Get SIZE_MAX.  *//* xsize.h -- Checked size_t computations.

   Upon success, return zero.  *//* Record the location of the current working directory in CWD so that
   the program may change to other directories and later use restore_cwd
   to return to the recorded location.  This function may allocate
   space using malloc (via getcwd) or leave a file descriptor open;
   use free_cwd to perform the necessary free or close.  Upon failure,
   no memory is allocated, any locally opened file descriptors are
   closed;  return non-zero -- in that case, free_cwd need not be
   called, but doing so is ok.  Otherwise, return zero.

   The _raison d'etre_ for this interface is that the working directory
   is sometimes inaccessible, and getcwd is not robust or as efficient.
   So, we prefer to use the open/fchdir approach, but fall back on
   getcwd if necessary.  This module works for most cases with just
   the getcwd-lgpl module, but to be truly robust, use the getcwd module.

   Some systems lack fchdir altogether: e.g., OS/2, pre-2001 Cygwin,
   SCO Xenix.  Also, SunOS 4 and Irix 5.3 provide the function, yet it
   doesn't work for partitions on which auditing is enabled.  If
   you're still using an obsolete system with these problems, please
   send email to the maintainer of this code.  *//* save-cwd.c -- Save and restore current working directory.

         that directory (which would leave the symlink dangling).
         Unfortunately, Solaris 9 is one of the platforms where the

         don't know whether name was an actual directory, or a symlink
         to a directory; and due to the bug of ignoring trailing
         slash, Solaris 9 would end up successfully unlinking the
         symlink instead of the directory.  Technically, we could use
         realpath to find the canonical directory name to attempt
         deletion on.  But that is a lot of work for a corner case; so
         we instead just use an lstat on the shortened name, and
         reject symlinks with trailing slashes.  The root user of
         unlink(1) will just have to live with the rule that they
         can't delete a directory via a symlink.  *//* Work around Solaris 9 bug where unlink("file/") succeeds.  *//* Remove file NAME.

   symlinks.  Fail with ENOSYS if the platform does not support
   changing symlink timestamps, but FILE was a symlink.  *//* Set the access and modification timestamps of FILE to be
   TIMESPEC[0] and TIMESPEC[1], respectively.  *//* !HAVE_WORKING_UTIMES *//* HAVE_FUTIMESAT || HAVE_WORKING_UTIMES *//* If these two subtractions overflow, they'll
                       track the overflows inside the buggy glibc.  *//* Work around a longstanding glibc bug, still present as
               of 2010-12-27.  On older Linux kernels that lack both
               utimensat and utimes, glibc's futimes rounds instead of
               truncating when falling back on utime.  The same bug
               occurs in futimesat with a null 2nd arg.  *//* If futimesat or futimes fails here, don't try to speed things
           up by returning right away.  glibc can incorrectly fail with
           errno == ENOENT if /proc isn't mounted.  Also, Mandrake 10.0
           in high security mode doesn't allow ordinary users to read
           /proc/self, so glibc incorrectly fails with errno == EACCES.
           If errno == EIO, EPERM, or EROFS, it's probably safe to fail
           right away, but these cases are rare enough that they're not
           worth optimizing, and who knows what other messed-up systems
           are out there?  So play it safe and fall back on the code

             It appears that utimensat can mistakenly return 280 rather
             than -1 upon ENOSYS failure.
             FIXME: remove in 2010 or whenever the offending kernels
             are no longer in common use.  *//* As recently as Linux kernel 2.6.32 (Dec 2009), several file
         systems (xfs, ntfs-3g) have bugs with a single UTIME_OMIT,
         but work if both times are either explicitly specified or
         UTIME_NOW.  Work around it with a preparatory [f]stat prior
         to calling futimens/utimensat; fortunately, there is not much
         timing impact due to the extra syscall even on file systems
         where UTIME_OMIT would have worked.

         The same bug occurs in Solaris 11.1 (Apr 2013).

         FIXME: Simplify this for Linux in 2016 and for Solaris in
         2024, when file system bugs are no longer common.  *//* POSIX 2008 added two interfaces to set file timestamps with
     nanosecond resolution; newer Linux implements both functions via
     a single syscall.  We provide a fallback for ENOSYS (for example,
     compiling against Linux 2.6.25 kernel headers and glibc 2.7, but
     running on Linux 2.6.18 kernel).  *//* Some Linux-based NFS clients are buggy, and mishandle timestamps
     of files in NFS file systems in some cases.  We have no
     configure-time test for this, but please see
     <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=132673> for references to
     some of the problems with Linux 2.6.16.  If this affects you,
     compile with -DHAVE_BUGGY_NFS_TIME_STAMPS; this is reported to
     help in some cases, albeit at a cost in performance.  But you
     really should upgrade your kernel to a fixed version, since the
     problem affects many applications.  *//* Require that at least one of FD or FILE are potentially valid, to avoid
     a Linux bug where futimens (AT_FDCWD, NULL) changes "." rather
     than failing.  *//* Set the access and modification timestamps of FD (a.k.a. FILE) to be
   TIMESPEC[0] and TIMESPEC[1], respectively.
   FD must be either negative -- in which case it is ignored --
   or a file descriptor that is open on FILE.
   If FD is nonnegative, then FILE can be NULL, which means
   use just futimes (or equivalent) instead of utimes (or equivalent),
   and fail if on an old system without futimes (or equivalent).
   If TIMESPEC is null, set the timestamps to the current time.
   Return 0 on success, -1 (setting errno) on failure.  *//* Normalize any UTIME_NOW or UTIME_OMIT values in *TS, using stat
   buffer STATBUF to obtain the current timestamps of the file.  If
   both times are UTIME_NOW, set *TS to NULL (as this can avoid some
   permissions issues).  If both times are UTIME_OMIT, return true
   (nothing further beyond the prior collection of STATBUF is
   necessary); otherwise return false.  *//* Work around Linux kernel 2.6.25 bug, where utimensat fails with
     EINVAL if tv_sec is not 0 when using the flag values of tv_nsec.
     Flag a Linux kernel 2.6.32 bug, where an mtime of UTIME_OMIT
     fails to bump ctime.  *//* Validate the requested timestamps.  Return 0 if the resulting
   timespec can be used for utimensat (after possibly modifying it to
   work around bugs in utimensat).  Return a positive value if the
   timespec needs further adjustment based on stat results: 1 if any
   adjustment is needed for utimes, and 2 if any adjustment is needed
   for Linux utimensat.  Return -1, with errno set to EINVAL, if
   timespec is out of range.  *//* Cache variables for whether the utimensat syscall works; used to
   avoid calling the syscall if we know it will just fail with ENOSYS,
   and to avoid unnecessary work in massaging timestamps if the
   syscall will work.  Multiple variables are needed, to distinguish
   between the following scenarios on Linux:
   utimensat doesn't exist, or is in glibc but kernel 2.6.18 fails with ENOSYS
   kernel 2.6.22 and earlier rejects AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW
   kernel 2.6.25 and earlier reject UTIME_NOW/UTIME_OMIT with non-zero tv_sec
   kernel 2.6.32 used with xfs or ntfs-3g fail to honor UTIME_OMIT
   utimensat completely works
   For each cache variable: 0 = unknown, 1 = yes, -1 = no.  *//* Solaris 9 mistakenly succeeds when given a non-directory with a
   trailing slash.  Force the use of rpl_stat for a fix.  *//* Avoid recursion with rpl_futimens or rpl_utimensat.  *//* On native Windows, use SetFileTime; but avoid this when compiling
   GNU Emacs, which arranges for this in some other way and which
   defines WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN itself.  *//* derived from a function in touch.c *//* Set file access and modification times.

langinfo.h *//* Just like nl_langinfo but get the information from the locale object L.  *//* Return the current locale's value for ITEM.
   If ITEM is invalid, an empty string is returned.

   The string returned will not change until `setlocale' is called;
   it is usually in read-only memory and cannot be modified.  *//* This macro produces an item you can pass to `nl_langinfo' or
   `nl_langinfo_l' to get the name of the locale in use for CATEGORY.  *//* This marks the highest value used.  *//* Output string for ``no''.  *//* Output string for ``yes''.  *//* Regex matching ``no'' input.  *//* Regex matching ``yes'' input.  *//* LC_NUMERIC category: formatting of numbers.
     These also correspond to members of `struct lconv'; see <locale.h>.  *//* LC_MONETARY category: formatting of monetary quantities.
     These items each correspond to a member of `struct lconv',
     defined in <locale.h>.  *//* LC_CTYPE category: character classification.
     This information is accessed by the functions in <ctype.h>.
     These `nl_langinfo' names are used only internally.  *//* LC_COLLATE category: text sorting.
     This information is accessed by the strcoll and strxfrm functions.
     These `nl_langinfo' names are used only internally.  *//* Number of indices in LC_TIME category.  *//* Jan *//* Abbreviated month names, in the grammatical form used when the month
     is named by itself.  *//* January *//* Long month names, in the grammatical form used when the month
     is named by itself.  *//* strftime format for date.  *//* Time in alternate era format.  *//* Date and time in alternate era format.  *//* Alternate symbols for digits.  *//* Date in alternate era format.  *//* Year in alternate era format.  *//* 12-hour time format for strftime.  *//* Time format for strftime.  *//* Date format for strftime.  *//* Date and time format for strftime.  *//* Post meridiem string.  *//* Ante meridiem string.  *//* Long month names, in the grammatical form used when the month

   (LC_*) and an item index within the category.  Some code may depend on
   the item values within a category increasing monotonically with the
   indices.  *//* Define the __LC_* category names.  *//* Get the type definition.  *//* Access to locale-dependent parameters.
